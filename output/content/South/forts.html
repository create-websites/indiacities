                <strong>About The Palace</strong> Located in the heart of the city, Mysore 
                Palace or the Maharajah&#39;s Palace is one of the most splendid palaces in Mysore. 
                The palace was the residence of the Wodeyar Mahararaja&#39;s of the Mysore State, 
                also known as Amba Vilas. This imposing, magnum opus is visited by hundreds of 
                people from all over the world daily. Initially the palace was chiseled out of 
                wood but was burnt down in 1897. Later in 1912 it was reconstructed by 
                &quot;Ranadheera Kantheerava Narasaraja wodeyar&quot;. The masterpiece collections of 
                precious works of art and exquisite artifacts from all over the worlds are the 
                treasures of the palace, showcased in the palace museum. Other attractions of 
                the palace are Soundarya Vilasa, Naama Teertha and 11 canons, which are placed 
                in the palace complex. There is a small private palace built by Srikanta Datta 
                Narasimharaja Wodeyar, an ancestor of the Wodeyar rulers as well as a member of 
                the parliament who still resides in the palace. The ground floor of the Mysore 
                Palace of Karnataka displays the personal belongings of the Wodeyar Mahararaja 
                while the upper floor displays collection of weapons belonging to the Maharajah. 
                The 200 kg gold royal throne of the Wodeyars is the most attractive artwork 
                possessed by the Mysore Palace at Karnataka that is exhibited to the public only 
                during the Dussera festival. The Mysore Palace is stunningly lighted every 
                Sunday nights and in the Dussera month.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>History of the palace</strong></p>
            <p>
                The word Mysore is a corrupted version of &quot;mysooru&quot;, which is derived from the 
                word &quot;mahishur&quot; or &quot;Mahishasurana Ooru&quot;, which means the town of Mahishasura in 
                Kannada, the local language. Mysore has been associated with the Puranic story 
                found in the Devi Bhagavatha. According to the story in the Devi Purana, Mysroe 
                was ruled by the demon Kind Mahishasura. Mahishasura was a buffalo-headed 
                monster. In response to the prayer by the Gods and Goddesses to save them from 
                the demon, Goddess Parvathi, took birth as Chamundeshwari and killed the monster 
                on top of the Chamundi hill near Mysore. Hence the hill and the city have the 
                names Chamundi Hill and Mysore respectively.It is said that after killing the 
                monster the Goddess stayed on top of the hill, where she is worshipped with 
                great devotion to this day. The famous 10 daylong Dasara of Mysore is in honour 
                of the Goddess Chamundeshwari and is a celebration of this victory of good over 
                evil. Before the rise of the Gangas in the 10th century there is little 
                historical evidence relating to Mysore. The Gangas established their supremacy 
                in the 2nd century and they ruled over a large part of Mysore till about 1004 
                AD. In the 3rd century they established their capital at Talakad on the banks of 
                the river Cauvery. There is an inscription on Chamundi Hills that was done in 
                950AD during the reign of the Gangas. This inscription is the oldest inscription 
                found in Mysore. The Cholas ruled Mysore for over a century after the Gangas. 
                The Chalukyas followed the Cholas</p>

        Vellore Fort (Tamil:வேலூர் கோட்டை) is a large 16th-century fort situated in 
        Vellore city near Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The Fort was at 
        one point of time the head quarters of the Vijayanagara Empire. The fort is 
        known for its grand ramparts, wide moat and robust masonry.The Fort&#39;s ownership 
        passed from Vijayanagara Kings, to the Bijapur Sultans, to Marathas, to the 
        Carnatic Nawabs and finally to the British, who held the fort until India gained 
        independence. During British rule, the Tippu Sultan&#39;s family and the last king 
        of Sri Lanka, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha were held in as royal prisoners in the fort. 
        The fort houses a Christian church, a Muslim mosque and a Hindu temple, the 
        latter of which is famous for its magnificent carvings. The first rebellion 
        against British rule erupted at this fort in 1806, and it is also a witness to 
        the tragic massacre of the Vijayanagara royal family of Emperor Sriranga Raya.</p>

    <h3>
        Belgaum Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Belgaum Fort, Kannada: ಬೆಳಗಾವಿ ಕೋಟೆ Belagaavi Kote, is located in the city of 
        Belgaum, in the Belgaum district, in Karnataka state, India. It was built by 
        Jaya Raya, also called Bichi Raja, an ally of the Ratta Dynasty, in the year 
        1204 AD. It has undergone several renovations over the centuries under different 
        dynastic rulers of the region.The fort, built with fine ramparts and a large 
        moat, has a rich history with several historical and religious monuments dated 
        to the Adil Shahi dynasty.[1][2][3][4] It is also notable in modern history 
        because Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned by the British in this fort during India’s 
        freedom struggle..</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The fort’s history is traced to the Ratta Dynasty with lineage to the 
        Rashtrakuta Dynasty, (earlier chieftains of Saundatti who later shifted their 
        capital to Belgaum), Vijayanagara emperors, Bijapur Sultans or Bahmanis, 
        Marathas (Shivaji and Peshwas), and finally by the British in that order. Prior 
        to Rattas, Shatavahanas, Chalukyas and Kadambas from Goa have also ruled over 
        the region.[6][7] The Belgaum fort belonged to the Ratta dynasty from the time 
        it was built in 1204 AD by a Ratta officer named Bichiraja. Belgaum the city 
        around the fort served as the capital of that dynasty between 1210 AD and 1250 
        AD. Rattas were defeated by the Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri and they briefly 
        controlled the fort. At the turn of the 1300s, the Khiljis of Delhi invaded the 
        region and succeeded in ruining both the indigenous powers of the region, the 
        Yadava and the Hoysalas without providing a viable administration. This lacuna 
        was made good by the Vijayanagara Empire, which had become the established power 
        of the area by 1336 AD.In 1474 AD, the Bahmani Sultanate, then ruling from 
        Bidar, captured the fort of Belgaum under the leadership of Mahamood Gawan. 
        Thereafter, in 1518 AD, the Bahamani Sultanate split up into five small states, 
        and Belgaum became part of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. The Ismail Adil 
        Shah of Adilshahi dynasty reinforced the fort with the help of Asad Khan Lari (a 
        Persian from the province of Lar) and much of the existing structures dates from 
        1519 AD.In 1686, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb defeated the Bijapur sultanate, 
        and Belgaum came under his control. This was a short-lived control because after 
        the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal empire&#39;s control declined. With this 
        changed situation, the Maratha confederacy, was taken over by the Peshwas. In 
        1776, Hyder Ali of Mysore won over this region, but only for a short period. The 
        Peshwas, with British assistance, defeated Hyder Ali and regained control of 
        Belgaum.With changed circumstances over the years, the same British attacked the 
        Belgaum fort, which was under Peshwas control, and held it under siege from 21 
        March to 12 April 1818, and took control of the fort and deposed the Peshwas. 
        Shivalinga Raju, the Kittur Desai, helped the British in this attack on the 
        fort.[11] As a reward, the British allowed Desai to rule over the Belgaum town 
        and the fort.</p>

    <h3>
        Chitradurga Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Chitradurga Fort (Kannada: ಚಿತ್ರದುರ್ಗದ ಕೋಟೆ), or as the British called it 
        Chitaldoorg, straddles several hills and a peak overlooking a flat valley in the 
        Chitradurga District, Karnataka, India. The fort&#39;s name Chitrakaldurga, which 
        means &#39;picturesque fort&#39; in Kannada, is the namesake of the town Chitradurga and 
        its administrative district.The Fort was built in stages between the tenth and 
        eighteenth centuries by the dynastic rulers of the region, including the 
        Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas and Hoysalas as well as the Nayakas of Chitradurga, 
        feudal lords in the Vijayanagar Empire. The Nayakas of Chitradurga, or Palegar 
        Nayakas, were most responsible for the expansion of the fort between the 15th 
        century and 18th century. They were defeated by Hyder Ali at Chitradurga in 1779 
        AD. Later the fort was expanded and strengthened by Hyder Ali and his son Tippu 
        Sultan,who succeeded Madakari Nayaka V, the last ruler of the Nayaka clan. The 
        fort is built in a series of seven concentric fortification walls with various 
        passages, a citadel, masjid, warehouses for grains and oil, water reservoirs and 
        ancient temples. There are 18 temples in the upper fort and one huge temple in 
        the lower fort. Among these temples the oldest and most interesting is the 
        Hidimbeshwara temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali’s 
        rule.[1][2][3][4] The fort&#39;s many interconnecting tanks were used to harvest 
        rain water, and the fort was said to never suffer from a water shortage.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        A number of inscriptions of the Chalukyas, the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar 
        kings have been found in and around the fort. These inscriptions trace the 
        history of the fort to the 3rd Millennium B.C. Ashokan period rock edicts found 
        near Brahmagiri also link Chitradurga to the Mauryan Empire during the reign of 
        the royal dynasties of Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas and Hoysalas. However, the area 
        where the fort now exists achieved prominence only under the dynastic rule of 
        the Nayakas of Chitradurga or &quot;Paleygars&quot; (called &quot;little Kings&quot;) as a feudatory 
        of the Vijayanagar Empire.Between 1500 AD and 1800 AD, Chitradurga Fort 
        witnessed a turbulent history starting with the Vijayanagar Empire; Vijayanagar 
        Empire had got control of this region from the Hoysalas. Vijaynagar rulers 
        brought the Nayakas, the traditional local chieftains of the area under their 
        control as their feudatory, till their dynastic reign ended in 1565 A.D. 
        Thereafter, the Nayakas of Chitradurga took independent control of the region 
        and their clan ruled for more than 200 years until the last of their rulers 
        Madakari Nayaka V was defeated by Hyder Ali of Mysore Kingdom, in 1779. During 
        all these years, Chitradurga Fort was central to the reign, particularly of the 
        Nayakas.Timmana Nayaka or Thimmappa Nayaka, a chieftain from Matti in Davangere 
        taluk, during the rule of Saluva Narasimha, was the first ruler in the hierarchy 
        of the Nayakas of Chitradurga. Initially, he was a chieftain under the 
        Vijayanagar Empire but was soon elevated to the rank of Governor of Chitradurga 
        by the Vijayanagar ruler in recognition of his excellent provence in military 
        service to the empire. His rule covered areas of the Davangere district and 
        Chitradurga district. His rule lasted for a brief period and ended with his 
        incarceration and death in the jail of the Vijaynagar Empire. After him, his son 
        Obana Nayaka or Madakari Nayaka (1588–1602) succeeded him. Madakari Nayaka was 
        followed by a series of hierarchical or other adopted forms of successions of 
        the same clan; Madakari Nayaka V was the final ruler of the clan from 1758 to 
        1779. Bharamappa Nayaka who ruled from 1689 till 1722 is regarded as the 
        greatest of the Nayaka rulers famed for building forts, palaces, tanks and 
        temples, including several gateways and bastions. He fought several battles 
        against the Mughals.However, it was during the reign of Madakari Nayaka V (1758 
        to 1779) that the city of Chitradurga and the Fort were besieged by the troops 
        of Hyder Ali. Madakari Nayaka used the fort effectively for defense during three 
        battles that were fought against Hyder Ali.[1] At times he had allied himself 
        with Hyder Ali of Mysore Kingdom and at other times with the Marathas. Hyder Ali 
        attacked the Chitradurga Fort first time in 1760, the second time in 1770 and 
        the third time successfully in 1779 when he defeated Madakari Nayaka. Madakari 
        Nayaka was taken a prisoner and killed. Nayaka&#39;s gamble of playing with both 
        Hyder Ali and the Marathas did not work out. He was betrayed by the Marathas and 
        some local Muhammadan officers in his service. Subsequent to his death the 
        treasury at the fort is said to have yielded a rich bounty. It was during one 
        such war that the heroics of Onake Obavva, the wife of a soldier guarding the 
        fort became a legendary event.The dynastic reign of the Nayakas lasted for over 
        200 years and the Chitradurga fort was their stronghold and the very heart of 
        their province.In the Fourth Mysore War, Tippu Sultan was killed by the British 
        in 1799, and the Mysore Kingdom was reordered under the Wodeyars. Chitradurga 
        became a part of Mysore province. The British considered Chitradurga Fort as a 
        potentially useful base for providing a strong line of defense to Mysore&#39;s 
        northern border. Between 1799 and 1809, the British garrisoned their troops in 
        the fort. Later, the control of the fort was restored to the Government of 
        Mysore.</p>

    <h3>
        Pallakkad Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Palakkad Fort (Tipu&#39;s Fort) is an old granite fort situated in the heart of 
        Palakkad town of Kerala state, southern India. It was built by Haider Ali in 
        1766 ACE and remains one of the best preserved forts in Kerala.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The Palakkad Fort is said to have existed from very ancient times it was made in 
        1766 A.D, but little is known of its early history. The local ruler, Palakkad 
        Achchan, was originally a tributary of the Zamorin, but had become independent 
        before the beginning of the eighteenth century. [1] In 1757 he sent a deputation 
        to Haider Ali seeking help against an invasion threatened by the Zamorin. Haider 
        Ali seized upon the opportunity to gain possession of a strategically important 
        location such as Palghat, and from that time until 1790 the fort was continually 
        in the hands of the Mysore Sultans or the British. It was first taken by the 
        latter in 1768 when Colonel Wood captured it during his raid on Haider Alis&#39;s 
        fortresses, but it was retaken by Haider a few months later. It was recaptured 
        by Colonel Fullarton in 1783, after a siege that lasted eleven days but was 
        abandoned the following year. It later fell into the hands of the Zamorin’s 
        troops. In 1790 it was finally captured by the British under Colonel Stuart. It 
        was renovated and was used as a base for operations that ended with the storming 
        of Srirangapatnam. The fort continued to be garrisoned until the middle of 19th 
        century. In the early 1900s it was converted into a taluk office.The fort is 
        also known as Tipu&#39;s Fort (after Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali).</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        There is a large ground between the Fort and the Palakkad Town hall, known as 
        Kota Maidanam (Fort Grounds). The ground, which had once served as a stable for 
        the elephants and horses of Tipu&#39;s army, is now used to stage cricket matches, 
        exhibitions and public meetings. An open air auditorium called &quot;Rappadi&quot;, 
        currently under the preservation of the Archaeological Survey of India, is also 
        located within the spacious grounds of the Fort. Additionally, there is a 
        children&#39;s park on one side of the Fort.There is a small Anjaneya (Lord Hanuman) 
        temple inside the fort that attracts a number of devotees.</p>

    <h3>
        Arnala Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Arnala Fort is built on a small island of the port town of Arnala, located 
        around 8 miles north of Vasai, Maharastra, India[1]. Being an island fort, it is 
        also called Jaldurg or Janjire-Arnala. The Portuguese, who owned this fort[2] 
        rebuilt and gave it the name Ilha das vacas.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        In 1516, a local chieftain in Gujarat, Sultan Mahmud Begda originally 
        constructed the fort on the island, strategically located at the mouth of the 
        Vaitarna river. In the 1530s, the Portuguese had established their operations in 
        the coastal area headquartered at Fort Bassein and soon gained control of the 
        island. The Portuguese captain of Bassein donated the island to a Portuguese 
        nobleman who tore down the old fort and began construction of 700x700 foot fort. 
        Though fort was never completed by the nobleman, it remained under Portuguese 
        control for 2 centuries, who used it to control shipping and navigation along 
        the northern Konkan coast.During the late 1600s and early 1700s, after a long 
        struggle with the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Confederacy came to dominate 
        present day Maharastra. In 1737 the then Peshwa Baji Rao I sent his brother, 
        Chimaji Appa, to take the Bassein Fort from the Portuguese. After winning the 
        Battle of Vasai, his general, Shankarji Pant, persuaded Chimaji to launch an 
        assault on Fort Arnala, for its strategic importance to the Maratha navy in 
        assaulting Portuguese interests. Their first assault, coordinated with a Maratha 
        naval force commanded by Manaji Agre, was routed by a superior Portuguese naval 
        force. A second assault on the fort on March 28, 1737, caught the Portuguese by 
        surprise and forced them to abandon the fort. The victory was commemorated by a 
        plaque installed on the northern wall of the fort and is still visible today. 
        Marathas then rebuilt the fort, constructing three bastions Bahirav, Bhavani and 
        Bava.The Marathas controlled the fort until 1817 when, during the third 
        British-Maratha war, despite successfully defending the fort, they were forced 
        to surrender the fort to the British due to their superior naval power. The 
        Arnala and Bassien forts were returned to the Marathas by the British in the 
        treaty of Salabai, but the forts again changed hands under the treaty of Pune. 
        Today the fort is in a state of disrepair.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        There is a large hexagonal fresh water reservoir inside the fort. Inside the 
        fort are the temples of Ambakeshwar, Goddess Bhavani, Lord Shiva, and the tombs 
        of Shahali and Hajjali. The &#39;paduka&#39; or sacred sandals of Shrinityanand Maharaj 
        are housed in a dome on the eastern face of the fort. The solid stone doorway is 
        adorned with pictures of tigers and elephants. The external ramparts are in a 
        fairly good condition, and a roughly 3-meter-wide path exists along the outer 
        walls.</p>

        The Barabati Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Barabati fort is situated at Lat.20o 19â€™N andLong.85o 52â€™E in between the 
        two rivers Mahanadi and Kathajuri at a distance of 25kms from the state capital 
        Bhubaneswar, Traditional history attributes the founding of this city to 
        Somavansi king Nrupakesari. The Madalapanji indicates that the fort was built in 
        the year 989 A.D. However many scholars like late Prof.P.Mukharjee believes that 
        Ganga king Anangabhimadeva III founded the city of Cuttack. He ruled from 1211 
        to 1238 A.D.According to a local legend, when the king was going to worship 
        Visvesvara Siva at Barabati village, he witnessed an unusual incident of a heron 
        killing a hawk. He was impressed with this incident and the strategic location 
        of the site and decided to shift his capital fromChudangagada (Chaudwar, 
        Cuttack) to Barabati village and named the city as Abhinava Varanasi Cuttack. 
        His Nagari copper plate grant was issued from this place in the year 1230 A.D. 
        During the rule of the Bhaumakaras, the placewas known to have existed. The 
        Bhauma Kingdom was occupied by the Somavansislater on to consolidate their 
        Kingdom in the Eastern Orissa, Nrupakesari was known tohave built a second 
        capital city at Cuttack. Systematic exploration, excavation and research will 
        definitely throw more light about the antiquity of this ancient township.</p>

    <h3>
        Gingee Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Gingee Fort also known as Chenji or Jinji in Tamil Nadu, India is one of the few 
        surviving forts in Tamil Nadu, India, which is more popular for its temples than 
        forts. It lies in Villupuram District,160 kilometres (99 mi) from the state 
        capital, Chennai, and is close to the Union Territory of Pondicherry. So well 
        fortified was this place that Shivaji ranked it as the &quot;most impregnable 
        fortress in India&quot; and it was called the &quot;Troy of the East&quot; by the British.The 
        nearest town with a railway station is Tindivanam and the nearest airport is 
        Chennai (Madras)-150 kilometres (93 mi)......</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Originally the site of a small fort built by the Chola dynasty in 9th century 
        AD, it was later modified by the Vijayanagar empire in the 13th century to 
        elevate it to the status of an unbreachable citadel to protect the small town of 
        Gingee. It was also the head quarters of the Gingee Nayaks, during the Nayaka 
        domination in Tamil Nadu. The fort was built as a strategic place of fending off 
        any invading armies. The fort was further strengthened by the Marathas under the 
        leadership of Shivaji in 1677 AD, who recaptured it from the Bijapur sultans who 
        had originally taken control of the fort from the Marathas. During Aurangzeb&#39;s 
        campaign in the Deccan, Shivaji&#39;s second son who had assumed the 
        throne,Chhatrapati Rajaram escaped to Ginjee in the distant South and continued 
        the fight with Moghuls from Ginjee. The Moghuls could not capture the fort for 
        seven years in spite of laying siege. The fort was finally captured in 1698, but 
        not before Chhatrapati Rajaram escaped. It was later passed on to the Carnatic 
        Nawabs who lost it to the French in 1750 before the British finally took control 
        in 1761 despite losing it to Hyder Ali for a brief period. Raja Desinghu ruled 
        Chenji an he was one of the famous kings to be known when it came to Chenji. He 
        also worshipped Singavaram Sri Ranganatha Temple located in between Chenji and 
        Melmalayanur. The temple is full of rock sculptures.The Bijapur Nawabs who held 
        the fort from about 1660-77 AD called it Badshabad, while the Marathas who 
        succeeded them called it Chandry or Chindy. The Mughals, on their capture of the 
        fort in 1698 A.D. named it Nasrat Gaddah in honour of Nawab Zulfiquar Khan 
        Nasrat Jang, the commander-in-chief of the besieging army. Later, the English 
        and the French called it Gingee or Jinji. The early Madras records of the 
        English give the spelling Chingee or Chengey.The chief source for the first two 
        hundred years of the history of the place is the &quot;Complete History of the 
        Carnatic Kings&quot; among the Mackenzie manuscripts. One Narayan, who claimed to be 
        a descendant of the Ananda Kon Clan of Gingee, compiled it, after a consultation 
        with numerous authorities, both Hindu and Muhammadan. According to Narayan, 
        Gingee became a fortified place only about 1200 AD. Ananda Kon of the shepherd 
        community, accidentally found a treasure in one of the cavities of the Western 
        hill while grazing his sheep. Making himself the head of a small band of 
        warriors, he defeated the petty rulers of the neighbouring villages and built a 
        small fortress on Kamalagiri, which he renamed Anandagiri after himself.The Kon 
        dynasty ruled Gingee from 1190 to 1330 AD, and was succeeded by the chief of a 
        neighbouring place called Kobilingan, who belonged to the kurumba caste and 
        ascended the throne of Gingee. He was a feudatory of the powerful Cholas. This 
        way Gingee came into the hands of various ruling dynasties of South India, 
        starting from the Cholas.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The fort consists of three hills, connected by walls enclosing an area of 7 
        square kilometres (2.7 sq mi). It was built at a height of 800 feet (240 m), and 
        protected by a 80 feet (24 m) wide moat. It had an eight-storeyed Kalyana Mahal 
        (marriage hall), granaries, prison cells, a military gymnasium and a temple 
        dedicated to its presiding Hindu goddess called Chenjiamman. The fortifications 
        contain a sacred pond known as Aanaikulam. The walls of the fort are a mixture 
        of the natural hilly terrain comprising the Krishnagiri, Chakkilidrug and 
        Rajagiri hills, while the gaps were sealed with the main wall that measures 20 
        metres (66 ft) in thickness. It was thus an impressive sight where the defender 
        could seal himself indefinitely.</p>
