    <h3>
        Taj Mahal</h3>
    <p>
        The Taj Mahal (English pronunciation: /ˈtɑːʒ məˈhɑːl/; Hindi:
            ताज महल  Persian/Urdu: تاج محل) is a mausoleum located in 
        Agra, India, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, 
        Mumtaz Mahal.While the white domed marble mausoleum is its most familiar 
        component, the Taj Mahal is actually an integrated complex of structures. 
        Building began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, and employed thousands 
        of artisans and craftsmen.[3] The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to 
        a board of architects under imperial supervision including Abd ul-Karim Ma&#39;mur 
        Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.[4][5] Lahauri is generally 
        considered to be the principal designer.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Soon after the Taj Mahal&#39;s completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son 
        Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Upon Shah Jahan&#39;s 
        death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoluem next to his wife.By the late 19th 
        century, parts of the buildings had fallen badly into disrepair. During the time 
        of the Indian rebellion of 1857, the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers 
        and government officials, who chiseled out precious stones and lapis lazuli from 
        its walls. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a 
        massive restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[31][32] He also 
        commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modeled after one in a 
        Cairo mosque. During this time the garden was remodeled with British-style lawns 
        that are still in place today.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The Taj Mahal was built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of 
        Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the center 
        of Agra in exchange for the land.[23] An area of roughly three acres was 
        excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and leveled at 50 metres (160 ft) 
        above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and 
        rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen 
        constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was 
        so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle. According 
        to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from 
        the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight. A fifteen 
        kilometer (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials 
        to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on 
        specially constructed wagons. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used 
        to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a 
        series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large 
        storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three 
        subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.The plinth and tomb 
        took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an 
        additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, 
        and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in 
        completion dates due to differing opinions on &quot;completion&quot;. For example, the 
        mausoleum itself was essentially complete by 1643, but work continued on the 
        rest of the complex. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to 
        difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost has been estimated 
        to be about 32 million Rupees at that time.The Taj Mahal was constructed using 
        materials from all over India and Asia and over 1,000 elephants were used to 
        transport building materials. The translucent white marble was brought from 
        Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise 
        was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came 
        from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty eight types of 
        precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.A labour 
        force of twenty thousand workers was recruited across northern India. Sculptors 
        from Bukhara, calligraphers from Syria and Persia, inlayers from southern India, 
        stonecutters from Baluchistan, a specialist in building turrets, another who 
        carved only marble flowers were part of the thirty-seven men who formed the 
        creative unit.</p>

        Shah Jahan shifted his capital from Agra to Shahjahanabad and laid the 
        foundation of Red Fort, or the Lal Quila, on 16th April 1639. It took nine years 
        to build this mighty citadel and it got completed on 16th April 1648. It is said 
        that about one crore rupees, an astronomical sum in those days, was spent on its 
        construction. Half of this sum was spent to build the exotic palaces within the 
        fort. Built of red sandstone, it is octagonal in shape, with two longer sides on 
        the east and west. The perimeter of its strong ramparts is about 2.41 km. Red 
        Fort rises to a height of 33.5 m on the town side and 18 m along the river. A 
        wide moat surrounds the fort, which was originally connected with the river and 
        was always filled with water. The two main gateways, known as Lahori Gate and 
        Delhi Gate (named so, as they face Lahore and Delhi respectively),are three 
        storeys high and are flanked by semi-octagonal towers. They are situated on the 
        centre of the western and southern sides respectively.</p>
    <div>
        </div>
    <p>
        The main entrance to the Lal Quila is through the Lahori Gate. Beyond the gate, 
        there is a roofed passage, flanked by arcaded apartments leading to the palaces, 
        known as Chhatta Chowk. These apartments are now used as shops. Besides these, 
        there are three more gates on other sides, which are kept closed now. The master 
        builders of the Red Fort were Hamid and Ahmad. Visitors are allowed only in a 
        part of Red Fort, as the army occupies the rest of it. Some of the main 
        buildings within the fort are:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Diwan-i-am</strong></p>
    <div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Diwan-i-Am or Hall of Public Audience is situated in the Red Fort of Delhi. It 
        originally had a courtyard on its front and was richly ornamented with gilded 
        stuccowork. Heavy curtains graced the main hall, which were three bays in depth. 
        The facade of nine openings of the arches rendered it a regal and imperial look 
        that impresses the visitors even today. One can easily imagine the splendor of 
        the court, covered with carpets and adorned with heavy chandeliers. It would 
        have easily dazzled the people who visited the emperor to pay their humble 
        homage. The emperor must have presented a really grand sight, seated on his 
        throne in the marble canopy or baldachin, which was covered most appropriately 
        by the beautiful &#39;Bengal&#39; roof.

        <strong>Moti Masjid</strong></p>
    <div>
        </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The personal mosque of Aurungzeb, Moti Masjid or Pearl Mosque lies to the west 
            of Hamam. Situated on a higher level than courtyards, the prayer-hall of the 
            mosque has inlaid black-marble outlines of &#39;musallas&#39; (small carpets for 
            prayers) and is surmounted by three bulbous domes. It is said that these domes 
            were originally copper plated and even the eastern door is plated with copper 
            leaves. The ladies of the seraglio also used the mosque to offer their prayers 
            to God.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>Mumtaz Mahal</strong></p>
    <div>
        &nbsp;<p>
            One of the original six main-palaces situated along the river front, Mumtaz 
            Mahal was also known as &#39;Chhoti Baithak&#39;. A beautiful water channel called 
            &#39;Nahr-i-Bihisht&#39; (meaning Stream of Paradise) flew through these palaces. 
            However, this palace has been removed, probably because it was totally in ruins. 
            The emperor used it to listen to the complaints of the general public and 
            receive their petitions here only. It has a marble dais, inlaid with precious 
            stones, below the throne and beautiful panels, inlaid with multicolored and 
            semi-precious stones, adorn its walls. These panels were said to be designed by 
            the Florentine jeweler, Austin de Bordeaux. The central panel depicts the Greek 
            god Orpheus with his lute. These panels were shifted to the Victoria and Albert 
            Museum in London by the British but were restored later in 1903, at the request 
            of Lord Curzon.

    <h3>
        Qutub Minar</h3>
    <p>
        The Qutb Minar (also spelled Qutab or Qutub, Urdu: قطب منار), a tower in Delhi, 
        India, is at 72.5 meters (237.8 ft) the world&#39;s tallest brick minaret. 
        Construction commenced in 1193 under the orders of India&#39;s first Muslim ruler 
        Qutb-ud-din Aibak, and the topmost storey of the minaret was completed in 1386 
        by Firuz Shah Tughluq. The Qutb Minar is notable for being one of the earliest 
        and most prominent examples of Indo-Islamic architecture.It is surrounded by 
        several other ancient and medieval structures and ruins, collectively known as 
        Qutb complex. The complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one 
        of the most popular tourist destinations in Delhi, and was also India&#39;s most 
        visited monument in 2006, as it attracted 3.9 million visitors, even more than 
        the Taj Mahal, which drew about 2.5 million visitors .</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Inspired by the Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan and wishing to surpass it, 
        Qutbuddin Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of Delhi, commenced construction of the 
        Qutb Minar in 1193, but could only complete its base. His successor, Iltutmish, 
        added three more stories and, in 1386, Firuz Shah Tughluq constructed the fifth 
        and the last story. The development of architectural styles from Aibak to 
        Tughluq is quite evident in the minaret. Like earlier towers erected by the 
        Ghaznavids and Ghurids in Afghanistan, the Qutb Minar comprises several 
        superposed flanged and cylindrical shafts, separated by balconies carried on 
        Muqarnas corbels. The minaret is made of fluted red sandstone covered with 
        intricate carvings and verses from the Qur&#39;an. The Qutb Minar is itself built on 
        the ruins of the Lal Kot, the Red Citadel in the city of Dhillika, the capital 
        of the Tomars and the Chauhans, the last Hindu rulers of Delhi. The complex 
        initially housed 27 ancient Hindu and Jain temples, which were destroyed and 
        their debris used to build the Qutb minar.[2] One engraving on the Qutb Minar 
        reads, &quot;Shri Vishwakarma prasade rachita&quot; (Conceived with the grace of 
        Vishwakarma), this is th The purpose for building this monument has been 
        variously speculated upon. It could take the usual role of a minaret, calling 
        people for prayer in the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, the earliest extant mosque 
        built by the Delhi Sultans. Other possibilities are a tower of victory, a 
        monument signifying the might of Islam, or a watch tower for defense. 
        Controversy also surrounds the origins for the name of the tower. Many 
        historians believe that the Qutb Minar was named after the first Turkish sultan, 
        Qutb-ud-din Aibak,[3] but others contend that it was named in honour of 
        Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki,[4] a saint from Transoxiana who came to live in India 
        and was greatly venerated by Iltutmish..The nearby Iron Pillar is one of the 
        world&#39;s foremost metallurgical curiosities, standing in the famous Qutb complex. 
        According to the traditional belief, anyone who can encircle the entire column 
        with their arms, with their back towards the pillar, can have their wish 
        granted. Because of the corrosive qualities of sweat the government has built a 
        fence around it for safety.The minar did receive some damage because of 
        earthquakes on more than a couple of occasions but was reinstated and renovated 
        by the respective rulers. During the rule of Firoz Shah, the minar&#39;s two top 
        floors were damaged due to an earthquake but were repaired by Firoz Shah. In the 
        year 1505, earthquake again struck and it was repaired by Sikandar Lodi. Later 
        on in the year 1794, the minar faced another earthquake and it was Major Smith, 
        an engineer who repaired the affected parts of the minar. He replaced Firoz 
        Shah&#39;s pavilion with his own pavilion at the top. The pavilion was removed in 
        the year 1848 by Lord Hardinge and now it can be seen between the Dak Bungalow 
        and the Minar in the garden. The floors built by Firoz Shah can be distinguished 
        easily as the pavilions was built of white marbles and are quite smooth as 
        compared to other ones.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The Qutab Minar is tall, with 379 steps leading to the top. The diameter of the 
        base is 14.3 meters, while the top floor measures 2.75 meters in diameter. 
        Surrounding the building are many fine examples of Indian artwork from the time 
        it was built in 1193. A second tower was in construction and planned to be 
        taller than the Qutb Minar itself. Its construction ended abruptly when it was 
        about 12 meters tall.The name of this tower is given as Alai Minar and 
        construction of recent studies shows that this structure has been tilted in one 
        direction. It is made of red sandstone all the way except for two stories at the 
        top. This part is of white marble and was made by Firoz Shah Tughlaq. He had 
        decided to put a prominent finish to the magnificent minar</p>

    <h3>
        Jantar Mantar</h3>
    <p>
        Jantar Mantar has a remarkable collection of architectural astronomical 
        instruments. It portrays noteworthy attempt of the ancestors, who were 
        interested in astronomy and knowledge of celestial bodies. Above all, this 
        observatory still, provides accurate information, which can be compared with 
        today&#39;s modern instruments undeniably. The compound instruments, whose settings 
        and shapes are scientifically designed depicts the forte of Medieval Indian 
        Astronomy.Jantar Mantar at Jaipur is the largest stone observatory in the World 
        and this feature makes it, a special destination for a traveler. Jantar Mantar 
        of Jaipur is one of the five astronomical observatories built by Maharaja Jai 
        Singh, the founder of Jaipur. During the period between 1727 and 1733, Jantar 
        Mantar took its form and structure. Initially Jantar Mantar was named as Yantra 
        Mantra, which means instruments and formulae, but due to mispronunciation of the 
        term, it is changed to the recognized name.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Maharaja Jai Singh was a fanatical astronomer himself who studied various works 
        from Hindu, Muslim and European astronomy. He had the perception that the tables 
        used by the pundits were deceptive and the actual planetary changes and 
        predictions of eclipses would not have been possible through these measuring 
        parameters. So he thought that he would find an improved and efficient means 
        through which exact prediction could be made. It was his own inspiration and 
        foresightedness that gave shape to such an instrument. He built other 
        observatories at Jaipur, Ujjain, Benares and Mathura to have an exact 
        calculation. It took almost seven years before the whole structure was fully 
        operational because he wanted to be fully satisfied with the accuracy of the 
        instruments at Jantar Mantar.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Jantar Mantar is wholly constructed with stone and marble. The observatory has 
        fourteen statistical instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses and to 
        ascertain other astronomical events. Amongst all the instruments, the Sundial 
        usually attracts the maximum attention of people, which tells the time to an 
        accuracy of about two seconds in local time of Jaipur. Jantar Mantar was 
        carefully renovated in 1901 and was declared a national monument in 1948. Today, 
        Jantar Mantar has become a major tourist attraction in Jaipur.

        Gate of Delhi was completed in February 1921.
    </p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        History of India GateSituated at the eastern end of Rajpath in Central Delhi is 
        the 42 m high stone arch of victory, renowned as the India Gate. Formally known 
        as the All India War Memorial previously, the foundation stone of this 
        magnanimous structure was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and dedicated to 
        the nation in 1931 by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Designed by Sir Edwin 
        Lutyens, the India Gate stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in 
        stages to a huge cornice. Above on both sides is inscribed INDIA, flanked by MCM 
        and to the right, XIX. The names of the 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who 
        lost their lives in World War-I, and an additional 13,516 names who sacrificed 
        their lives in the North-West Frontier in the Afghan War of 1919 are inscribed 
        on the walls of this grand construction. In order to honor the numerous unknown 
        gallant soldiers who died fighting for the country, an eternal flame or Amar 
        Jawan Jyoti was lit under the arch of India Gate in 1971. Uniformed soldiers 
        stand guard over the flame. As a tribute to these dead soldiers, a shining rifle 
        crowned by a soldier&#39;s helmet is placed on a high pedestal near the flame.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Another additional 13,516 names engraved on the arch and foundations form a 
        separate memorial to the British and Indian soldiers killed on the North-West 
        Frontier in the Afghan War of 1919. The foundation stone was laid by HRH the 
        Duke of Connaught in 1921 and the monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years 
        later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was 
        added much later after India had said goodbye to its imperial rulers. It is in 
        the form of a flame that burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation 
        of soldiers who perished in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.The entire 
        arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge 
        cornice, beneath which are inscribed Imperial suns. Above on both sides is 
        inscribed INDIA, flanked by MCM and to the right, XIX. The shallow domed bowl at 
        the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries but this is 
        rarely done.

        Jodha Bai Palace</h3>
    <p>
        The beauty of the red sand stone charms you the moment you step within the 
        vicinity of the Fatehpur Sikri while on a Tour to Uttar Pradesh. Elegance 
        personified, the entirety of the complex of Fatehpur Sikri is adorned with some 
        of the finest elements of the reign of the Mughals. Characteristic in its 
        grandeur, which corresponds to the regality of the Mughals, the entirety of 
        Fatehpur Sikri is a definite must include if you are planning a tour to Uttar 
        Pradesh. Of the Monuments in Fatehpur Sikri, perhaps one of the most notable is 
        the Palace of Jodha Bai, Fatehpur Sikri.
    </p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Built as a form of homage to the memory of the memory of the great Sufi saint, 
        Sheikh Salim Chisti, who, it is said, blessed the emperor with an heir to the 
        Mughal throne in India, who was to be later known as Jahangir, Fatehpur Sikri 
        was built in 1571 and stood as the capital of the Mughal empire till the year 
        1585 when it was abandoned due to what, today is guessed by historians to be a 
        severe water shortage. Declared recently as one of the prestigious World 
        Heritage Monuments by UNESCO, Fatehpur Sikri is today one of the most popular 
        tourist destinations while on a trip to Uttar Pradesh.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The palace of Jodha Bai or the Rajput queen of Emperor Akbar, the Palace of 
        Jodha Bai in Fatehpur Sikri is one of the most charming examples of the 
        amalgamation of the apparently opposing architectural styles of the Rajputs and 
        the Mughals. The palace, which is located on the eastern side of the entirety of 
        the fort, was used, according to modern historians as a residence for the 
        various queens of Akbar as well as the other members of the harem. Corresponding 
        to the style used in Hindu architecture, the main palace has a courtyard, around 
        which the entirety of the palace is built. The living quarters are all built 
        after keeping the courtyard as the center of the complex. Added to the

        Aligarh Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Aligarh Fort (Hindi: अलीगढ़ क़िला, Urdu: علی گڑھ قلعہ Aligarh Qila) one of the 
        strongest forts in India, is located in the city of Aligarh (The city was 
        earlier named as Kol or Koil), Uttar Pradesh. It is also called &quot;Aligarh Qila&quot;. 
        It is situated on the Grand Trunk road and consists of a regular polygon, 
        surrounded by a very broad and deep ditch.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        It was built during the time of Ibrahim Lodi by Muhammad, son of Umar the 
        governor of Kol, in 1524-25. Sabit Khan who was the governor of this region 
        during the time of Farrukh Siyar and Muhammad Shah, further rebuilt the fort. 
        [2] It became a fortress of great importance under Madhavrao I Scindia in 1759, 
        and was the depot where he drilled and organized his battalions in the European 
        fashion with the aid of French soldier Benoît de Boigne. During the Battle of 
        Ally Ghur, it was captured from the Marathas under the leadership of a French 
        officer Perron by Lord Gerard Lake&#39;s British army, in September 1803, since 
        which time it has been much strengthened and improved. In the rebellion of 1857 
        the troops stationed at Aligarh mutinied, but abstained from murdering their 
        officers, who, with the other residents and ladies and children, succeeded in 
        reaching Hathras.</p>

            Allahabad Fort</h3>
        <p>
            Uttar Pradesh has been holding the Allahabad Fort in city of Allahabad, which is 
            visited by tourists from all over the world. This majestic fort was built by 
            emperor Akbar during his reign, in the year 1583 A.D. The fort is located on the 
            banks of the river Yamuna at the confluence site. It is said to be the largest 
            fort built by Akbar and is considered one of the best garrisons in the entire 
            Mughal Empire.The Allahabad Fort is a magnificent structure, which is very 
            famous and well known for the construction methodology used, the designs and the 
            architecture. Now it is used by the Army people and very few spots are open to 
            the public. For visiting other areas prior permission is required to take from 
            the army officials. This huge and grand fort has three magnificent galleries 
            flanked by high towers. The outer walls are still intact and rise above the 
            water edge.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            (Hindi: इलाहाबाद क़िला, Urdu: الہ آباد قلعہ Ilāhābād Qila) at 
            Allahabad,Uttarpradesh,built by Emperor Akbar in 1583.[1] The fort stands on the 
            banks of the Yamuna near the site of confluence with river Ganges. It is the 
            largest fort built by Akbar. In its prime, the fort was unrivaled for its 
            design, construction and craftsmanship. This huge fort has three galleries 
            flanked by high towers.Allahabad is an extremely important and integral part of 
            the Ganga Yamuna Doab, and its history is inherently tied with that of the Doab 
            region, right from the inception of the town.</p>
        <h3>
            Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            There are many interesting places inside the Allahabad Fort. Out of which, the 
            mighty structure of the Ashoka Pillar that was earthed by the great Mayuran king 
            Ashoka in 232 BC is a highlight. Many other places worth visiting inside are the 
            Saraswati Kund, which is supposed to be the source of the mythical river 
            Saraswati. Another interesting and attractive monument is the Jodhabai Mahal, 
            which is known for its subtle design. The architecture of the mahal or palace 
            consists of the fusion of Hindu and Islamic architecture pattern. The Akshaya 
            Vat is a sacred location. It means the immortal tree, which is considered 
            religious. It is believed that if anyone jumped from this old banyan tree he or 
            she would attain immortality. The Patalpuri temple is also located in the 
            Allahabad Fort. All these form the basic attractions inside the fort.</p>

    <h3>
        Sanchi Stupa</h3>
    <p>
        Sanchi is a small village in Raisen District of the state of Madhya Pradesh, 
        India, it is located 46 km north east of Bhopal, and 10 km from Besnagar and 
        Vidisha in the central part of the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the location 
        of several Buddhist monuments dating from the third century BCE to the twelfth 
        century CE and is one of the important places of Buddhist pilgrimage. It is a 
        nagar panchayat in Raisen district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. 
        Toranas surround the Stupa and they each represent love, peace, trust, and 
        courage.The &#39;Great Stupa&#39; at Sanchi was originally commissioned by the emperor 
        Ashoka the Great in the third century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple 
        hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was 
        crowned by the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was 
        intended to honour and shelter the relics.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The stupa was vandalized at one point, sometime in the second century BCE, an 
        event some have related to the rise of the Sunga emperor Pusyamitra Sunga. It 
        has been suggested that Pushyamitra may have destroyed the original stupa, and 
        his son Agnimitra rebuilt it.[2] During the later rule of the Sunga, the stupa 
        was expanded with stone slabs to almost twice its original size. The dome was 
        flattened near the top and crowned by three superimposed parasols within a 
        square railing. With its many tiers it was a symbol of the dharma, the Wheel of 
        the Law. The dome was set on a high circular drum meant for circumambulation, 
        which could be accessed via a double staircase. A second stone pathway at ground 
        level was enclosed by a stone balustrade with four monumental gateways (toranas) 
        facing the cardinal directions. The buildings which seem to have been 
        commissioned during the rule of the Sungas are the Second and Third stupas (but 
        not the highly decorated gateways, which are from the following Satavahana 
        period, as known from inscriptions), and the ground balustrade and stone casing 
        of the Great Stupa.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The Stupa at Sanchi is one the most wonderful structures of ancient India. It 
        has been included by the UNESCO as one of the heritage sites of the world. The 
        Sanchi Stupa is a fine example of the development of the Buddhist architecture 
        and sculpture beginning from the 3rd century B.C. to the 12th century A.D. The 
        site of Sanchi was discovered in the year 1818 by General Taylor and an 
        archaeological museum was established in 1919y Sir John Marshall.
