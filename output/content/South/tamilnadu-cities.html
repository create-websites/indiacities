Later, after many years, it came under the rule of the British East India Company, after the company signed a treaty with the brave Tipu Sultan in 1799. This is when John Sullivan started the development of the hill station and promoted it as an ideal summer retreat. Lots of cottages, clubs and other buildings were built to house and provide recreational facilities to the British officials. Soon enough, the hill station was growing tea for its inhabitants, who considered high tea to be an integral part of their day. Now, these tea estates not only produce the favorite drink of millions of Indians but also add to the charm and the beauty of the hill resort of Ooty India.&nbsp;</p>
