        History of TirupatiVenkateswara Temple, Tirumala</h3>
    <p>
        The glorious history of this temple spans for several centuries. There is 
        literary evidence as well as a lot of engraved inscriptions that point out to 
        the antiquity of this temple.Kings belonging to the Chola, the Pandya and the 
        Pallava dynasty have been regular visitors to this temple. Sri Krishnadevaraya 
        was an important contributor and endowed the temple with rich offerings. A 
        permanent endowment fund was set up by the Maratha general Rajhoji Bhonsle so 
        that regular worship in the temple could be carried out without any hindrance. 
        With the coming of the Muslim rulers, the temple came under their supervision 
        and at a further later period, the British were transferred the power. 
        Eventually the East India Company decided that they would no longer take the 
        responsibility of administering native religious institution.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sri Seva Dossji of the Hatiramji Mutt at Tirumala was entrusted with the 
        responsibility. They continued to hold power for over a century till 1933. Then 
        in 1933 the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Committee took over. Finally in the 
        year 1951, a Board of Trustees took over the administration of this grand 
        temple.</p>

        Introduction to Tirupati Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala</h3>
    <p>
        The Tirupati Venkateswara Temple is one of the most important pilgrim sites for 
        Hindus. It is visited by a large number of devotees every year. Located on the 
        seventh peak of the Tirupati Hill, this ancient temple is a must see for all 
        tourists. It is emblematic of wonderful architecture. One can also get an idea 
        of the tremendous faith that people have in this deity when they visit the 
        temple. Individuals willingly stand in long queues just to get a glimpse of the 
        lord housed in the richest temple. A visit to the temple is like a spiritual 
        sojourn that simply overwhelms the senses.</p>
    <p>

        Description of Tirupati Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala<img 
            alt="Chandagiripalace" class="style3"

            title="Chandagiripalace" /></h3>
    <p>
        The outer Gopuram of the temple is inscribed with figures of Vaishnava gods. You 
        will surely be impressed by the architectural brilliance of these craftsmen.</p>
    <p>
        There are several Mandapams in the temple. The Ranga Mandapam reflects the 
        Vijaynagara style of architecture and was constructed between 1320 and 1360 A.D. 
        It is believed that when Srirangam was occupied by the Muslim rulers, the idol 
        of Lord Ranganadha was kept here. The Tiruamla Raya Mandapam is a spacious 
        complex of pavilions. The Dhvajasthamba Mandapam is a complex with a large 
        number of pillars. You will simply be fascinated to see the remarkable 
        sculptures that are there in this Mandapam. The central pillar of this Mandapam 
        is surrounded by several small pillars. Strike one of these pillars with a small 
        stone and you will surely be amazed to find that they emit musicalsounds. Bronze 
        statues also adorn this Mandapam. The Aina Mahal is rightly named because there 
        are a large number of ainas or mirrors which reflects images on its walls. It 
        consists of two parts. There is an open Mandapam with a total of 36 pillars and 
        a shrine consisting an Antarala and Garbagriha.</p>
    <p>
        The portals of the temples are adorned with statues of Krishnadevaraya and his 
        consorts which were installed by Krishnadevaraya himself. The Maratha general 
        Rajhoji Bhonsle gifted valuable jewels and that included emeralds which have 
        been retained to this day.</p>
