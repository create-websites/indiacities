        History of Chhattisgarh</h3>
    <p>
        According to a mythological legend, Ram, during his Vanvas stayed in Dakshin 
        Kosala. Which is modern day Chhattisgarh. The unbroken history of Chhattisgarh 
        or of South Kosala can be traced back to fourth century AD and its mythological 
        history goes back as far back as the Mahabarata and the Ramayana. About the 
        history of the region the famous historian C.W.Wills writes, &#39;in the 10th 
        century AD a powerful Rajput family ruled at Tripuri near Jabalpur, Issuing from 
        this kingdom of Chedi (also known as Kalchuri dynasty) a scion of the royal 
        house by the name Kalingraja, settled about the year 1000AD, at Tuman, a site at 
        present marked only by a few ruins in the north east of the erstwhile 
        Laphazamidari of The Bilaspur district. His grandson Ratanraja founded Ratanpur 
        Which continued as the capital of a large part of the country now known as 
        Chhattisgarh.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Rajput family called themselves the Haihaya dyanasty. This dynasty 
        continued ruling Chhattisgarh for six centuries about the 14th century it split 
        into parts, the elder branch continued at Ratanpur, while the younger settled in 
        semi-independent state at Raipur. At the end of 16th century it acknowledged the 
        suzerainty of the Mughals, In Bastar, in the middle ages, Chalukya dynasty 
        established its rule. The first Chalukya ruler was Annmdev, who established the 
        dynasty in Bastar in 1320 .
    </p>
    <h3>
        Culture</h3>
    The Culture prevailing in Raipur district is that of Chhattisgarh. 
    &#39;Chhattisgarhi&#39; is the local language that most of the people in this area love 
    to converse in. Chhattisgarh culture in itself is very rich and interesting. 
    &#39;Baigas&#39; (traditional medical practitioners) apply their own methods (called 
    Jhad phook) to cure diseases and snake bites etc. However, known for their 
    modesty, kindness and adjustable nature people of this area are fond of variety 
    in dressing, entertainment and way of living. This culture has unique styles of 
    music and dance. Raut Nacha, Dewar Nacha, Panthi &amp; Soowa, Padki and Pandwani are 
    some of musical styles and dance dramas. Pandwani is a famous musical way of 
    singing Mahabharata in this region. This particular music style has been brought 
    into lime light by well known Teejan Bai and young Ritu Verma. Colourful dresses 
    and variety of ornaments are worn by women
