His father was displeased with him because of his immense devotion at a very young age.He used to spend a large part of his day in worshipping lord Ganesha.

Finally he found him in the forest worshipping Lord Ganesh. As he was quite angry with complaints, he disrupted the puja, threw away the idol of Ganesh and beat his son. Even then also Balal was in favour of worshipping,so his father’s anger rose to high level and he tied him to a tree. After tying him to a tree he then left the forest asserting that let Lord Ganesh himself will come and rescue him. <br/></font></span>
