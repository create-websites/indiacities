    <h3>
        Gateway Of India</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most prized possessions of the country, the Gateway of India is 
        situated on the waterfront in South Mumbai. Anyone coming to Mumbai from this 
        harbor is greeted by the huge monument, which stands as a testimony to the 
        imperial bygone era of the city. As you pass through the gate from the city 
        side, the first scene that looms into view is that of the waterfront of South 
        Mumbai. A popular harbor, it is used by a large number of people for traveling 
        to the other parts of Bombay, especially the Elephanta Island. The first major 
        event that took place at the Gateway of India was the passing of the First 
        Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry. They were the last troops of the 
        British to leave India after independence. The ceremony was conducted on 28th 
        February 1948.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The main idea behind the construction of the Gateway of India was to celebrate 
        the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Bombay. Sir George Sydenham Clarke, 
        the then Governor of Bombay, laid down the foundation stone of the monument in 
        March 1911. However, his plan was approved in 1914 and the reclamations at 
        Apollo Bundar got completed in 1919. Designed by George Wittet, an architect, 
        Gateway of India took approximately 4 years (1920 to 1924) to get fully 
        completed.The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the visit of King George 
        V and Queen Mary to Bombay, prior to the Darbar in Delhi in December 1911. The 
        foundation stone was laid on March 31, 1911 by the Governor of Bombay, with 
        George Wittet&#39;s final design sanctioned in August 1914. Between 1915 and 1919 
        work proceeded on reclamations at Apollo Bunder for the land on which the 
        gateway and the new sea wall would be built. The foundations were completed in 
        1920, and construction was finished in 1924. The Gateway was opened on December 
        ...
    </p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The architecture of the Gateway of India comprises of a huge arch, which is 
        approximately 26 m in height. The entire structure has been made by using yellow 
        basalt and reinforced concrete. It has mainly been constructed as per the 
        Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. One can also find the features of the 
        Muslim architectural styles that were very much popular in Gujarat in the 16th 
        century. The top of the monument stands adorned with a central dome, which has a 
        diameter of 15 m. The construction of the Gateway of India led to the 
        displacement of the harbor and it had to be completely realigned. The monument 
        was constructed in the early 20th century, at the astronomical price of 21 lakh 
        rupees. The major burden of the cost was undertaken by the Government of India. 
        However, even the 21 lakh rupees could not prove sufficient and the idea of 
        constructing an approach road from the monument had to be discarded. The 
        construction work of Gateway of India was undertaken by Gammon India Limited, 
        established by J C Gammon.</p>

    <h3>
        Arnala Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Arnala Fort is built on a small island of the port town of Arnala, located 
        around 8 miles north of Vasai, Maharastra, India[1]. Being an island fort, it is 
        also called Jaldurg or Janjire-Arnala. The Portuguese, who owned this fort[2] 
        rebuilt and gave it the name Ilha das vacas.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        In 1516, a local chieftain in Gujarat, Sultan Mahmud Begda originally 
        constructed the fort on the island, strategically located at the mouth of the 
        Vaitarna river. In the 1530s, the Portuguese had established their operations in 
        the coastal area headquartered at Fort Bassein and soon gained control of the 
        island. The Portuguese captain of Bassein donated the island to a Portuguese 
        nobleman who tore down the old fort and began construction of 700x700 foot fort. 
        Though fort was never completed by the nobleman, it remained under Portuguese 
        control for 2 centuries, who used it to control shipping and navigation along 
        the northern Konkan coast.During the late 1600s and early 1700s, after a long 
        struggle with the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Confederacy came to dominate 
        present day Maharastra. In 1737 the then Peshwa Baji Rao I sent his brother, 
        Chimaji Appa, to take the Bassein Fort from the Portuguese. After winning the 
        Battle of Vasai, his general, Shankarji Pant, persuaded Chimaji to launch an 
        assault on Fort Arnala, for its strategic importance to the Maratha navy in 
        assaulting Portuguese interests. Their first assault, coordinated with a Maratha 
        naval force commanded by Manaji Agre, was routed by a superior Portuguese naval 
        force. A second assault on the fort on March 28, 1737, caught the Portuguese by 
        surprise and forced them to abandon the fort. The victory was commemorated by a 
        plaque installed on the northern wall of the fort and is still visible today. 
        Marathas then rebuilt the fort, constructing three bastions Bahirav, Bhavani and 
        Bava.The Marathas controlled the fort until 1817 when, during the third 
        British-Maratha war, despite successfully defending the fort, they were forced 
        to surrender the fort to the British due to their superior naval power. The 
        Arnala and Bassien forts were returned to the Marathas by the British in the 
        treaty of Salabai, but the forts again changed hands under the treaty of Pune. 
        Today the fort is in a state of disrepair.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        There is a large hexagonal fresh water reservoir inside the fort. Inside the 
        fort are the temples of Ambakeshwar, Goddess Bhavani, Lord Shiva, and the tombs 
        of Shahali and Hajjali. The &#39;paduka&#39; or sacred sandals of Shrinityanand Maharaj 
        are housed in a dome on the eastern face of the fort. The solid stone doorway is 
        adorned with pictures of tigers and elephants. The external ramparts are in a 
        fairly good condition, and a roughly 3-meter-wide path exists along the outer 
        walls.</p>

    <h3>
        The Barabati Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Barabati fort is situated at Lat.20o 19â€™N andLong.85o 52â€™E in between the 
        two rivers Mahanadi and Kathajuri at a distance of 25kms from the state capital 
        Bhubaneswar, Traditional history attributes the founding of this city to 
        Somavansi king Nrupakesari. The Madalapanji indicates that the fort was built in 
        the year 989 A.D. However many scholars like late Prof.P.Mukharjee believes that 
        Ganga king Anangabhimadeva III founded the city of Cuttack. He ruled from 1211 
        to 1238 A.D.According to a local legend, when the king was going to worship 
        Visvesvara Siva at Barabati village, he witnessed an unusual incident of a heron 
        killing a hawk. He was impressed with this incident and the strategic location 
        of the site and decided to shift his capital fromChudangagada (Chaudwar, 
        Cuttack) to Barabati village and named the city as Abhinava Varanasi Cuttack. 
        His Nagari copper plate grant was issued from this place in the year 1230 A.D. 
        During the rule of the Bhaumakaras, the placewas known to have existed. The 
        Bhauma Kingdom was occupied by the Somavansislater on to consolidate their 
        Kingdom in the Eastern Orissa, Nrupakesari was known tohave built a second 
        capital city at Cuttack. Systematic exploration, excavation and research will 
        definitely throw more light about the antiquity of this ancient township.</p>

    <h3>
        Bekal Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Bekal Fort (Malayalam: ബേക്കല്‍ കോട്ട) is the largest fort in the state of 
        Kerala, India, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2). The important features of 
        this fort are the water-tank with its flight of steps, the tunnel opening 
        towards the south, the magazine for keeping ammunition and the broad and wide 
        steps leading to the Observation Tower which is a rarity. From there one has 
        ample view of towns in the vicinity like Kanhangad, Pallikare, Bekal, 
        Kottikkulam, Uduma etc. This observation center had strategic significance in 
        discovering even the smallest movements of the enemy and ascertaining safety of 
        the Fort.The Fort appears to have been built up from the sea since almost three 
        fourth of its exteriors is drenched and the waves continually stroke the 
        citadel. The Mukhyaprana Temple of Hanuman and the ancient Muslim Mosque nearby 
        bear testimony to the age-old religious harmony that prevailed in the area. The 
        zigzag entrance and the trenches around the fort show the defense strategy 
        inherent in the fort.Unlike most other Indian Forts, Bekal fort was not a center 
        of administration for no remains of any palace, mansion or such buildings are 
        found within the fort. Arguably the fort was built exclusively for fulfilling 
        defense requirements. The holes on the outer walls of the fort are specially 
        designed to defend the fort effectively. The holes at top were meant for aiming 
        at the farthest points; the holes below for striking when the enemy was nearer 
        and the holes underneath facilitated attacking when the enemy was very near to 
        the fort. This is a remarkable evidence of technology in defense strategy.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        During the Perumal Age Bekal was a part of Mahodayapuram. The Kodavalam 
        inscription (Pullur, 7 km from Kanhangad) of Bhasakara Ravi II (the King of 
        Mahodayapuram) illustrate the undisputed political sway of Mahodayapuram over 
        this region. Following the political decline of Mahodayapuram Perumals by the 
        12th century AD, North Kerala including Bekal, came under the sovereignty of 
        Mushika or Kolathiri or Chirakkal Royal Family (who were a secondary royal 
        family at that point to the Cheras, Pandyas and Cholas)[1][2]. The maritime 
        importance of Bekal increased much under the Kolathiris and it became an 
        important port town of Tulunadu and the Malabar.It was usual in older days for 
        every royal palace to be protected by a fort. The Bekal fort might have, 
        therefore, existed even from early days of the Chirakkal Rajas. While writing a 
        description of the Kolathiri Kingdom in his Kerala History, K.P. Padmanabha 
        Menon writes: &quot;The eldest of the male members reigned as sovereign Kolathiri. 
        The next in succession, the heir apparent, was the Thekkelamkur. The residence 
        assigned to him was the Vadakara fort. The third in succession was the 
        Vadakkelamkur in charge of Vekkolath fort. This V(B)ekkolath fort is identified 
        by some scholars as the present Bekal.H.A. Stuart, in his Handbook of South 
        Canara (1985), makes this observation: &quot;Several forts were built by the Shivappa 
        Nayaks of Badnore between 1650 and 1670. The two forts of Bekal and Chandragiri 
        were originally under the Kolathiri or Chirakkal Rajas until the time of 
        Shivappa Nayaka&#39;s invasion. Perhaps, the Bednore rulers might have rebuilt and 
        improved it.The Battle of Talikota in 1565 led to the decline of the mighty 
        Vijayanagara Empire and many feudatory chieftains rose in political prominence 
        including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayaks). The Nayakas realized the political 
        and economic importance of Tulunadu (which is the region comprising of 
        modern-day Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts along with the Northernmost part 
        of Kasargod District ) and attacked and annexed the region. Bekal served as a 
        nucleus in establishing the dominance of the Nayakas in Malabar. The economic 
        importance of the port town prompted the Nayakas to fortify Bekal subsequently. 
        Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka initiated the construction of the fort and it was 
        completed during the period of Shivappa Nayaka. The speedy completion of the 
        port was aimed at the defense of the fort from overseas attack and to strengthen 
        their attack on Malabar. Chandragiri fort near Kasargod was also constructed 
        during this period.Bekal served as an important military station of Tipu Sultan 
        when he led the great military expedition to capture Malabar. The coins and 
        other artifacts unearthed by the archaeological excavation conducted recently at 
        Bekal fort is a manifestation of the strong presence of the Mysore Sulthans. The 
        death of Tipu Sulthan in Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799 saw the end of Mysorean 
        control and subsequently the fort came under the British East India Company.</p>

    <h3>
        Belgaum Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Belgaum Fort, Kannada: ಬೆಳಗಾವಿ ಕೋಟೆ Belagaavi Kote, is located in the city of 
        Belgaum, in the Belgaum district, in Karnataka state, India. It was built by 
        Jaya Raya, also called Bichi Raja, an ally of the Ratta Dynasty, in the year 
        1204 AD. It has undergone several renovations over the centuries under different 
        dynastic rulers of the region.The fort, built with fine ramparts and a large 
        moat, has a rich history with several historical and religious monuments dated 
        to the Adil Shahi dynasty.[1][2][3][4] It is also notable in modern history 
        because Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned by the British in this fort during India’s 
        freedom struggle..</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The fort’s history is traced to the Ratta Dynasty with lineage to the 
        Rashtrakuta Dynasty, (earlier chieftains of Saundatti who later shifted their 
        capital to Belgaum), Vijayanagara emperors, Bijapur Sultans or Bahmanis, 
        Marathas (Shivaji and Peshwas), and finally by the British in that order. Prior 
        to Rattas, Shatavahanas, Chalukyas and Kadambas from Goa have also ruled over 
        the region.[6][7] The Belgaum fort belonged to the Ratta dynasty from the time 
        it was built in 1204 AD by a Ratta officer named Bichiraja. Belgaum the city 
        around the fort served as the capital of that dynasty between 1210 AD and 1250 
        AD. Rattas were defeated by the Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri and they briefly 
        controlled the fort. At the turn of the 1300s, the Khiljis of Delhi invaded the 
        region and succeeded in ruining both the indigenous powers of the region, the 
        Yadava and the Hoysalas without providing a viable administration. This lacuna 
        was made good by the Vijayanagara Empire, which had become the established power 
        of the area by 1336 AD.In 1474 AD, the Bahmani Sultanate, then ruling from 
        Bidar, captured the fort of Belgaum under the leadership of Mahamood Gawan. 
        Thereafter, in 1518 AD, the Bahamani Sultanate split up into five small states, 
        and Belgaum became part of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. The Ismail Adil 
        Shah of Adilshahi dynasty reinforced the fort with the help of Asad Khan Lari (a 
        Persian from the province of Lar) and much of the existing structures dates from 
        1519 AD.In 1686, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb defeated the Bijapur sultanate, 
        and Belgaum came under his control. This was a short-lived control because after 
        the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal empire&#39;s control declined. With this 
        changed situation, the Maratha confederacy, was taken over by the Peshwas. In 
        1776, Hyder Ali of Mysore won over this region, but only for a short period. The 
        Peshwas, with British assistance, defeated Hyder Ali and regained control of 
        Belgaum.With changed circumstances over the years, the same British attacked the 
        Belgaum fort, which was under Peshwas control, and held it under siege from 21 
        March to 12 April 1818, and took control of the fort and deposed the Peshwas. 
        Shivalinga Raju, the Kittur Desai, helped the British in this attack on the 
        fort.[11] As a reward, the British allowed Desai to rule over the Belgaum town 
        and the fort.</p>

        Chitradurga Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Chitradurga Fort (Kannada: ಚಿತ್ರದುರ್ಗದ ಕೋಟೆ), or as the British called it 
        Chitaldoorg, straddles several hills and a peak overlooking a flat valley in the 
        Chitradurga District, Karnataka, India. The fort&#39;s name Chitrakaldurga, which 
        means &#39;picturesque fort&#39; in Kannada, is the namesake of the town Chitradurga and 
        its administrative district.The Fort was built in stages between the tenth and 
        eighteenth centuries by the dynastic rulers of the region, including the 
        Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas and Hoysalas as well as the Nayakas of Chitradurga, 
        feudal lords in the Vijayanagar Empire. The Nayakas of Chitradurga, or Palegar 
        Nayakas, were most responsible for the expansion of the fort between the 15th 
        century and 18th century. They were defeated by Hyder Ali at Chitradurga in 1779 
        AD. Later the fort was expanded and strengthened by Hyder Ali and his son Tippu 
        Sultan,who succeeded Madakari Nayaka V, the last ruler of the Nayaka clan. The 
        fort is built in a series of seven concentric fortification walls with various 
        passages, a citadel, masjid, warehouses for grains and oil, water reservoirs and 
        ancient temples. There are 18 temples in the upper fort and one huge temple in 
        the lower fort. Among these temples the oldest and most interesting is the 
        Hidimbeshwara temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali’s 
        rule.[1][2][3][4] The fort&#39;s many interconnecting tanks were used to harvest 
        rain water, and the fort was said to never suffer from a water shortage.</p>
&nbsp;<h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        A number of inscriptions of the Chalukyas, the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar 
        kings have been found in and around the fort. These inscriptions trace the 
        history of the fort to the 3rd Millennium B.C. Ashokan period rock edicts found 
        near Brahmagiri also link Chitradurga to the Mauryan Empire during the reign of 
        the royal dynasties of Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas and Hoysalas. However, the area 
        where the fort now exists achieved prominence only under the dynastic rule of 
        the Nayakas of Chitradurga or &quot;Paleygars&quot; (called &quot;little Kings&quot;) as a feudatory 
        of the Vijayanagar Empire.Between 1500 AD and 1800 AD, Chitradurga Fort 
        witnessed a turbulent history starting with the Vijayanagar Empire; Vijayanagar 
        Empire had got control of this region from the Hoysalas. Vijaynagar rulers 
        brought the Nayakas, the traditional local chieftains of the area under their 
        control as their feudatory, till their dynastic reign ended in 1565 A.D. 
        Thereafter, the Nayakas of Chitradurga took independent control of the region 
        and their clan ruled for more than 200 years until the last of their rulers 
        Madakari Nayaka V was defeated by Hyder Ali of Mysore Kingdom, in 1779. During 
        all these years, Chitradurga Fort was central to the reign, particularly of the 
        Nayakas.Timmana Nayaka or Thimmappa Nayaka, a chieftain from Matti in Davangere 
        taluk, during the rule of Saluva Narasimha, was the first ruler in the hierarchy 
        of the Nayakas of Chitradurga. Initially, he was a chieftain under the 
        Vijayanagar Empire but was soon elevated to the rank of Governor of Chitradurga 
        by the Vijayanagar ruler in recognition of his excellent provence in military 
        service to the empire. His rule covered areas of the Davangere district and 
        Chitradurga district. His rule lasted for a brief period and ended with his 
        incarceration and death in the jail of the Vijaynagar Empire. After him, his son 
        Obana Nayaka or Madakari Nayaka (1588–1602) succeeded him. Madakari Nayaka was 
        followed by a series of hierarchical or other adopted forms of successions of 
        the same clan; Madakari Nayaka V was the final ruler of the clan from 1758 to 
        1779. Bharamappa Nayaka who ruled from 1689 till 1722 is regarded as the 
        greatest of the Nayaka rulers famed for building forts, palaces, tanks and 
        temples, including several gateways and bastions. He fought several battles 
        against the Mughals.However, it was during the reign of Madakari Nayaka V (1758 
        to 1779) that the city of Chitradurga and the Fort were besieged by the troops 
        of Hyder Ali. Madakari Nayaka used the fort effectively for defense during three 
        battles that were fought against Hyder Ali.[1] At times he had allied himself 
        with Hyder Ali of Mysore Kingdom and at other times with the Marathas. Hyder Ali 
        attacked the Chitradurga Fort first time in 1760, the second time in 1770 and 
        the third time successfully in 1779 when he defeated Madakari Nayaka. Madakari 
        Nayaka was taken a prisoner and killed. Nayaka&#39;s gamble of playing with both 
        Hyder Ali and the Marathas did not work out. He was betrayed by the Marathas and 
        some local Muhammadan officers in his service. Subsequent to his death the 
        treasury at the fort is said to have yielded a rich bounty. It was during one 
        such war that the heroics of Onake Obavva, the wife of a soldier guarding the 
        fort became a legendary event.The dynastic reign of the Nayakas lasted for over 
        200 years and the Chitradurga fort was their stronghold and the very heart of 
        their province.In the Fourth Mysore War, Tippu Sultan was killed by the British 
        in 1799, and the Mysore Kingdom was reordered under the Wodeyars. Chitradurga 
        became a part of Mysore province. The British considered Chitradurga Fort as a 
        potentially useful base for providing a strong line of defense to Mysore&#39;s 
        northern border. Between 1799 and 1809, the British garrisoned their troops in 
        the fort. Later, the control of the fort was restored to the Government of 
        Mysore.</p>

    <h3>
        Daulatabad Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Daulatabad (Marathi दौलताबाद; Persian دولت‌آباد meaning “City of Prosperity”), 
        is a 14th century fort city in Maharashtra, India, about 16 kilometers northwest 
        of Aurangabad. The place, was once as known as Deogiri, (circa the sixth century 
        AD, when it was an important uplands city along caravan routes and is now but a 
        village, based around the former city of the same name.Starting 1327, it 
        famously remained the capital of Tughlaq dynasty, under Muhammad bin Tughluq (r. 
        1325-1351), who also changed its name, and forcibily moved the entire population 
        of Delhi here, for two years, before it was abandoned due to lack of water.The 
        area of the city includes the hill-fortress of Devagiri (Marathi देवगिरी) 
        (sometimes Latinised to Deogiri). It stands on a conical hill, about 200 meters 
        high. Much of the lower slopes of the hill has been cut away by Yadava dynasty 
        rulers to leave 50 meter vertical sides to improve defenses. The fort is a place 
        of extraordinary strength. The only means of access to the summit is by a narrow 
        bridge, with passage for not more than two people abreast, and a long gallery, 
        excavated in the rock, which has for the most part a very gradual upward 
        slope.About midway along this gallery, the access gallery has steep stairs, the 
        top of which is covered by a grating destined in time of war to form the hearth 
        of a huge fire kept burning by the garrison above. At the summit, and at 
        intervals on the slope, are specimens of massive old cannon facing out over the 
        surrounding countryside. Also at the mid way, there is a cave entrance meant to 
        confuse the Enemies.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The site had been occupied since at least 100 BCE, and now has remains of 
        Buddhist caves similar to those at Ajanta and Ellora.The city is said to have 
        been founded c. 1187 by Bhillama V, a prince who renounced his allegiance to the 
        Chalukyas and established the power of the Yadava dynasty in the west.There is a 
        tradition that Deoghur or Doulatabad was built in 1203 AD by a Dhangar or 
        herdsman who acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth was named by his 
        brother shepherds Rajah Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Rajah.In 1294 
        the fort was captured by Ala-ud-din Khilji, and the rajas, so powerful that they 
        were held by the Sultans of Delhi to be the rulers of all the Deccan, were 
        reduced to pay tribute. The tribute falling into arrear, Devagiri was again 
        occupied by the Muslims under Malik Kafur, in 1307 and 1310, and in 1318 the 
        last raja, Harpal, was flayed alive.Devagiri now became an important base for 
        the operations of the Delhi Sultanate&#39;s conquering expeditions southwards. In 
        1327 Muhammad bin Tughluq determined to make it his capital, changed its name to 
        Daulatabad , and tried to march the whole population of Delhi to it.The project 
        was interrupted by troubles which summoned him to the north; during his absence 
        the Muslim governors of the Deccan revolted; and Daulatabad itself fell into the 
        hands of Zafar Khan, the governor of Gulbarga. It remained in the hands of the 
        Bahmanis till 1526, when it was taken by the Nizam Shahis. It was captured by 
        the Mughal emperor Akbar, but in 1595 it again surrendered to Ahmad Nizam Shah 
        of Ahmednagar, on the fall of whose dynasty in 1607 it passed into the hands of 
        the usurper, the Nizam Shahi minister Malik Amber, originally an Abyssinian 
        slave, who was the founder of Kharki (the present Aurangabad).His successors 
        held it until they were overthrown by Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, in 1633; 
        after which it remained in the possession of the Delhi emperors until, after the 
        death of Aurangzeb, it fell to the first Nizam of Hyderabad. Its glory, however, 
        had already decayed owing to the removal of the seat of government by the 
        emperors to Aurangabad.</p>

        Gingee Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Gingee Fort also known as Chenji or Jinji in Tamil Nadu, India is one of the few 
        surviving forts in Tamil Nadu, India, which is more popular for its temples than 
        forts. It lies in Villupuram District,160 kilometres (99 mi) from the state 
        capital, Chennai, and is close to the Union Territory of Pondicherry. So well 
        fortified was this place that Shivaji ranked it as the &quot;most impregnable 
        fortress in India&quot; and it was called the &quot;Troy of the East&quot; by the British.The 
        nearest town with a railway station is Tindivanam and the nearest airport is 
        Chennai (Madras)-150 kilometres (93 mi)......</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Originally the site of a small fort built by the Chola dynasty in 9th century 
        AD, it was later modified by the Vijayanagar empire in the 13th century to 
        elevate it to the status of an unbreachable citadel to protect the small town of 
        Gingee. It was also the head quarters of the Gingee Nayaks, during the Nayaka 
        domination in Tamil Nadu. The fort was built as a strategic place of fending off 
        any invading armies. The fort was further strengthened by the Marathas under the 
        leadership of Shivaji in 1677 AD, who recaptured it from the Bijapur sultans who 
        had originally taken control of the fort from the Marathas. During Aurangzeb&#39;s 
        campaign in the Deccan, Shivaji&#39;s second son who had assumed the 
        throne,Chhatrapati Rajaram escaped to Ginjee in the distant South and continued 
        the fight with Moghuls from Ginjee. The Moghuls could not capture the fort for 
        seven years in spite of laying siege. The fort was finally captured in 1698, but 
        not before Chhatrapati Rajaram escaped. It was later passed on to the Carnatic 
        Nawabs who lost it to the French in 1750 before the British finally took control 
        in 1761 despite losing it to Hyder Ali for a brief period. Raja Desinghu ruled 
        Chenji an he was one of the famous kings to be known when it came to Chenji. He 
        also worshipped Singavaram Sri Ranganatha Temple located in between Chenji and 
        Melmalayanur. The temple is full of rock sculptures.The Bijapur Nawabs who held 
        the fort from about 1660-77 AD called it Badshabad, while the Marathas who 
        succeeded them called it Chandry or Chindy. The Mughals, on their capture of the 
        fort in 1698 A.D. named it Nasrat Gaddah in honour of Nawab Zulfiquar Khan 
        Nasrat Jang, the commander-in-chief of the besieging army. Later, the English 
        and the French called it Gingee or Jinji. The early Madras records of the 
        English give the spelling Chingee or Chengey.The chief source for the first two 
        hundred years of the history of the place is the &quot;Complete History of the 
        Carnatic Kings&quot; among the Mackenzie manuscripts. One Narayan, who claimed to be 
        a descendant of the Ananda Kon Clan of Gingee, compiled it, after a consultation 
        with numerous authorities, both Hindu and Muhammadan. According to Narayan, 
        Gingee became a fortified place only about 1200 AD. Ananda Kon of the shepherd 
        community, accidentally found a treasure in one of the cavities of the Western 
        hill while grazing his sheep. Making himself the head of a small band of 
        warriors, he defeated the petty rulers of the neighbouring villages and built a 
        small fortress on Kamalagiri, which he renamed Anandagiri after himself.The Kon 
        dynasty ruled Gingee from 1190 to 1330 AD, and was succeeded by the chief of a 
        neighbouring place called Kobilingan, who belonged to the kurumba caste and 
        ascended the throne of Gingee. He was a feudatory of the powerful Cholas. This 
        way Gingee came into the hands of various ruling dynasties of South India, 
        starting from the Cholas.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The fort consists of three hills, connected by walls enclosing an area of 7 
        square kilometres (2.7 sq mi). It was built at a height of 800 feet (240 m), and 
        protected by a 80 feet (24 m) wide moat. It had an eight-storeyed Kalyana Mahal 
        (marriage hall), granaries, prison cells, a military gymnasium and a temple 
        dedicated to its presiding Hindu goddess called Chenjiamman. The fortifications 
        contain a sacred pond known as Aanaikulam. The walls of the fort are a mixture

    <h3>
        Hawa Mahal</h3>
    <p>
        Hawa Mahal (Hindi: हवा महल, translation: &quot;Palace of Winds&quot; or “Palace of the 
        Breeze”), is a palace in Jaipur, India. It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai 
        Pratap Singh, and designed by Lal Chand Usta in the form of the crown of 
        Krishna, the Hindu god. Its unique five-story exterior is also akin to the 
        honeycomb of the beehive with its 953 small windows called jharokhas that are 
        decorated with intricate lattice work.[1] The original intention of the lattice 
        was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life in the street below without 
        being seen, since they had to observe strict &quot;purdah&quot; (face cover).Built of red 
        and pink sandstone, the palace is situated on the main thoroughfare in the heart 
        of Jaipur’s business centre. It forms part of the City Palace, and extends to 
        the Zenana or women&#39;s chambers, the chambers of the harem. It is particularly 
        striking when viewed early in the morning, lit with the golden light of sunrise.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh the ruler of Rajasthan of the Kachwaha clan, was the 
        original planner and builder who built the Jaipur city in 1727. However, it was 
        his grandson Sawai Pratap Singh, son of Maharaja Sawai Madhosingh I, who built 
        the Hawa Mahal in 1799 as a continuation of the Royal City Palace. Pratap 
        Singh&#39;s deep devotion to the Hindu god Lord Krishna is inferred to have prompted 
        him to build it as a dedication, in the form of a Mukuta or headgear, adorning 
        the Lord. Though no historical record is available to its exact history, it is 
        conjectured that Royal family ladies, who were under strict observance of purdah 
        (the practice of preventing women from being seen by men), had to be given 
        opportunity to witness proceedings in the market centre and watch the royal 
        processions and festivities sitting behind the stone carved screens. Hawa Mahal 
        did just that in style, amidst its luxurious comforts and behind strict screened 
        exclusivity, unseen by outsiders.Royal family of Jaipur, during their reign, 
        also used the Mahal as a hot weather retreat, during the suffocating summer 
        season, for several years, since the unusually designed window screens provided 
        the needed cool breeze.</p>

        Sinhagad Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Sinhagad or Sinhgad (Marathi: सिंहगड, The Lion&#39;s Fort), is a fortress located 
        roughly 30 kilometres southwest of the city of Pune, India. It is situated on a 
        hill rising 800 metres above the surrounding countryside. Previously called 
        Kondana (Marathi: कोंढाणा), the fort has been the site of many important 
        battles, most notably the battle of Sinhagad in 1670. It was also strategically 
        located at the center of a string of other forts such as Rajgad, Purandar and 
        Torna.Perched on an isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range of the Sahyadri 
        Mountains, its height above sea-level is 1350 metres. Given natural protection 
        by its very steep slopes, the walls and bastions were constructed at only key 
        places; it has two gates – the Kalyan Darwaza in the south-east and the Pune 
        Darwaza in the north-east.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        This fort has been quite a long history, referred to as &#39;Kondhana&#39; in a Persian 
        poem named &#39;Shahanama-e-Hind&#39;, dating back to 1350 A.D.[citation needed] It was 
        called &#39;Kondana&#39; after the sage Kaundinya. The Kaundinyeshwar temple, the caves 
        and the carvings indicate that this fort had probably been built two thousand 
        years back. It was captured from the Koli tribal chieftain, Nag Naik, by 
        Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1328 AD.Shivaji Bhosale,as the commander of Ibrahim Adil 
        Shah I, was entrusted with the control of the Pune region. His son Shivaji, 
        however, refused to accept the Adilshahi and initiated the task of setting up 
        Swarajya. He gained control of Kondana in 1647 by convincing Siddi Amber, the 
        Adilshahi Sardar who controlled the fort. Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande played key 
        role in this activity.In 1649, it had to be handed over to Adil Shah for Shahaji 
        Maharaj&#39;s release. Shivaji Maharaj recaptured it back in 1656 again with the 
        help of Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande,who convinced Fort commander by giving land in 
        newly created Shivapur village and peacefully gained control of fort.This Fort 
        saw attacks of Moguls on 1662,1663 and 1665.In 1664,Shahistekhan- mogul general 
        even tried to bribe people of fort to hand over the fort to him but he was 
        unsuccessful.Unfortunately in a Purandar Pact it went into the hands of the 
        Mughal army chief Mirzaraje Jaysingh, in the year 1665. In 1670, Shivaji Maharaj 
        re-conquered this fort and then it stayed under Maratha rule till 1689. After 
        the death of Sambhaji , the Mughals regained control over. Again in 1693 the 
        Marathas recaptured it headed by Sardar Balkawade. Chatrapati Rajaram took 
        asylum on this fort during Mogul raid on Satara but Rajaram died on Sinhagad on 
        the 3rd of March 1700 &amp; in 1703 Aurangzeb conquered the fort. In 1706, it once 
        again went into the hands of the Marathas. Pantaji Shivdev of Sangola and the 
        PantPratinidhis played key role in this battle. Then this fort remained with 
        Maraths till 1818, when the British conquered it.British however took three 
        months to capture this fort highest time ever for them to win any fort in the 
        Maharastra..</p>

    <h3>
        Janjira Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Murud-Janjira is the local name for a fort situated at the coastal village of 
        Murud, in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India.[1] It is famous for being 
        the only fort along India&#39;s western coast that remained undefeated despite 
        Maratha, Dutch and English East India Company attacks.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The word Janjira is not native to India, and may have originated after the 
        Arabic word Jazeera, which means an island. Murud was once known in Marathi as 
        Habsan, or Abyssinian&#39;s land. Some of the people also split the name as &quot;JAL 
        JEERA&quot; meaning fort in the water.The name of the fort is a concatenation of the 
        Konkani and Arabic words for Island, &quot;morod&quot; and &quot;jazeera&quot;.The word &quot;morod&quot; is 
        peculiar to Konkani and is absent in Marathi.Thus, during the rains, the fields 
        get flooded,but the morods never flood.The State of Murud-Janjira was known to 
        the Maratha Empire as Habsan,the land of the Habshis.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Sambhaji Maharaj (Son of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj)constructed a fort on a 
        nearby island (Padmadurg Fort, now known as Kasa). Kasa is not accessible to the 
        public and requires special permission from the Navy.To Reach the Janjira Fort, 
        sailboats are available from Murud Port (which is behind Ekdara Village) and 
        Rajpuri port.Murud doesn&#39;t just have a Beach &amp; the fort. It also has a Temple 
        over the hill next to the New Bus Depot (known as Datta cha Dongar) Hill of Lord 
        Dattatray. One can have a paranormic view of Murud &amp; both the islands together 
        from the hill.Further ahead of the hill is an Idga Mosque, the walk though the 
        dense jungle is a experience in itself.The fort also boasts of a sweet water 
        lake inside it. It is considered to be a miracle that the Fort surrounded by the 
        salty water of the sea has a lake full of sweet water. Also the cannons in the 
        fort are quite unique. The biggest cannon boasts a range of around 18 km. It is 
        said that since the entire cannon could not have been transported at once they 
        had to be brought in pieces and they were then assembled inside the fort.</p>

        Jantar Mantar</h3>
    <p>
        Jantar Mantar has a remarkable collection of architectural astronomical 
        instruments. It portrays noteworthy attempt of the ancestors, who were 
        interested in astronomy and knowledge of celestial bodies. Above all, this 
        observatory still, provides accurate information, which can be compared with 
        today&#39;s modern instruments undeniably. The compound instruments, whose settings 
        and shapes are scientifically designed depicts the forte of Medieval Indian 
        Astronomy.Jantar Mantar at Jaipur is the largest stone observatory in the World 
        and this feature makes it, a special destination for a traveler. Jantar Mantar 
        of Jaipur is one of the five astronomical observatories built by Maharaja Jai 
        Singh, the founder of Jaipur. During the period between 1727 and 1733, Jantar 
        Mantar took its form and structure. Initially Jantar Mantar was named as Yantra 
        Mantra, which means instruments and formulae, but due to mispronunciation of the 
        term, it is changed to the recognized name.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Maharaja Jai Singh was a fanatical astronomer himself who studied various works 
        from Hindu, Muslim and European astronomy. He had the perception that the tables 
        used by the pundits were deceptive and the actual planetary changes and 
        predictions of eclipses would not have been possible through these measuring 
        parameters. So he thought that he would find an improved and efficient means 
        through which exact prediction could be made. It was his own inspiration and 
        foresightedness that gave shape to such an instrument. He built other 
        observatories at Jaipur, Ujjain, Benares and Mathura to have an exact 
        calculation. It took almost seven years before the whole structure was fully 
        operational because he wanted to be fully satisfied with the accuracy of the 
        instruments at Jantar Mantar.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Jantar Mantar is wholly constructed with stone and marble. The observatory has 
        fourteen statistical instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses and to 
        ascertain other astronomical events. Amongst all the instruments, the Sundial 
        usually attracts the maximum attention of people, which tells the time to an 
        accuracy of about two seconds in local time of Jaipur. Jantar Mantar was 
        carefully renovated in 1901 and was declared a national monument in 1948. Today, 
        Jantar Mantar has become a major tourist attraction in Jaipur.

    <h3>
        Jodha Bai Palace</h3>
    <p>
        The beauty of the red sand stone charms you the moment you step within the 
        vicinity of the Fatehpur Sikri while on a Tour to Uttar Pradesh. Elegance 
        personified, the entirety of the complex of Fatehpur Sikri is adorned with some 
        of the finest elements of the reign of the Mughals. Characteristic in its 
        grandeur, which corresponds to the regality of the Mughals, the entirety of 
        Fatehpur Sikri is a definite must include if you are planning a tour to Uttar 
        Pradesh. Of the Monuments in Fatehpur Sikri, perhaps one of the most notable is 
        the Palace of Jodha Bai, Fatehpur Sikri.
    </p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Built as a form of homage to the memory of the memory of the great Sufi saint, 
        Sheikh Salim Chisti, who, it is said, blessed the emperor with an heir to the 
        Mughal throne in India, who was to be later known as Jahangir, Fatehpur Sikri 
        was built in 1571 and stood as the capital of the Mughal empire till the year 
        1585 when it was abandoned due to what, today is guessed by historians to be a 
        severe water shortage. Declared recently as one of the prestigious World 
        Heritage Monuments by UNESCO, Fatehpur Sikri is today one of the most popular 
        tourist destinations while on a trip to Uttar Pradesh.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The palace of Jodha Bai or the Rajput queen of Emperor Akbar, the Palace of 
        Jodha Bai in Fatehpur Sikri is one of the most charming examples of the 
        amalgamation of the apparently opposing architectural styles of the Rajputs and 
        the Mughals. The palace, which is located on the eastern side of the entirety of 
        the fort, was used, according to modern historians as a residence for the 
        various queens of Akbar as well as the other members of the harem. Corresponding 
        to the style used in Hindu architecture, the main palace has a courtyard, around 
        which the entirety of the palace is built. The living quarters are all built 
        after keeping the courtyard as the center of the complex. Added to the 
        brilliance of the red sandstone are the turquoise bricks, which are used on the 
        roofs of the buildings.

    <h3>
        Lalgarh Palace
    </h3>
    <p>
        Lalgarh Palace is a palace in Bikaner in the Indian state of Rajasthan.The 
        palace was built between 1902 and 1926 according to Rajput, Mughal and European 
        architectural styles. The building was commissioned by the British controlled 
        regency[1] for Maharaja Ganga Singh (1881–1942) while he was still in his 
        minority as they considered the existing Junagarh palace unsuitable for a modern 
        monarch. Ganga Singh decided that the palace should be named in memory of his 
        father Maharaja Lall Singh.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The complex was designed by the British architect Sir Samual Swinton Jacob. 
        After a ritual blessing ceremony construction commenced in 1896 on empty land 5 
        miles[2] from the existing Junagarh Palace on what is now Dr. Karni Singhji 
        Road. The palace was arranged around two courtyards with the first and most 
        impressive wing, Laxmi Niwas completed in 1902.[2] The remaining three wings 
        were completed in stages with final completion of the complex accomplished in 
        1926.[3] Lord Curzon was the palace&#39;s first notable guest. Ganga Singh was 
        legendary for his shikars (hunts) at his hunting preserve at Gajner, in 
        particular his Imperial Sand Grouse hunts at Christmas.[4] As a result the 
        palace hosted many guests including Georges Clemenceau in 1920, Queen Mary, King 
        George V, Lord Harding and Lord Irwin.The palace was originally designed to cost 
        100,000 rupees[5] due to the planned use of cheaper materials including the 
        suggestion of using stucco instead of carved stone in the construction. Soon 
        however all cost cutting was abandoned and by time of the completion of the 
        first wing the cost had increased to 1 million rupees[5] due to the use of the 
        finest materials including the widespread employment of finely carved stonework.</p>

    <h3>
        Lohagad Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Lohagad (literally &quot;Iron fort&quot; in Marathi) is one of the many hill forts of 
        Chatrapati Shivaji. It is situated 52 km from Pune in western India. Lohagad is 
        at an elevation of 3,450 feet (1,052 m).Lohagad and Visapur Forts are situated 
        atop an impressive hill near Malavali, 52 km away from Pune. These forts were 
        built in the 18th century. A 1 km long ridge separates the two forts. These 
        forts are regarded to be ideal for trekking and can be toured in a day from 
        Pune. Lohagad, which is 3,400 feet high, is a very wide spread fort. Ganesh 
        Darwaja, Narayan Darwaja, Hanuman Darwaja and Maha Darwaja are the four doors to 
        Lohagad from the nearby village. A few sculptures are still visible on Maha 
        Darwaja.
    </p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        The history of the place dates around 2000 to 2500 years back. At that time, 
        Lohagad was one of the major forts of the Satwaahan dynasty. The fort owes its 
        name to the sage Lomesh who was meditating on Lohagad. It was mainly built to 
        keep Nana Maval , Andhra Maval and Korbaarse Maval in check. But after the 
        collapse of the Bahamani kingdom , the fort Lohagad in Pune was captured by 
        Nizamshahi in 1489. Thereafter, the fort passed into different hands. The 
        seventh brother of the Nizam who ruled from1590 to 1594 was imprisoned here. In 
        1630, the fort was captured by Adilshah, and Shivaji Maharaj took it under his 
        control in 1648. In the year 1665, the fort was successively attacked by Mirza 
        Raja Jaysingh who invaded Purandhar and by Kutubuddin , who looted the villages 
        surrounding the fort Lohagad in Pune. Shivaji Maharaj captured it again in 1670, 
        Aurangzeb , in 1700 and Balaji Vishwanath in 1720. Bajirao II ruled the fort in 
        1802 until it went finally to the British hands under Colonel Prother in 1818. 
        Surprisingly, the fort is still intact till date. There are some inscriptions on 
        the walls, which reveal vital information about its history. There are two go 
        downs here. They are called the Narayan and the Hanuman Darwaaja . The Laxmi 
        Kothi is the only place to rest in the fort. Besides, the tomb of Sheikh Umar , 
        Vinchu Kata and the Ganesh Darwaaja are also worth visiting.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        It divides the basins of the Indrayani and Pavna and is situated on a side range 
        of the Sahyadris. The Visapur fort is located on its eastern side. The four 
        large gates of Lohagad are still in good condition and reasonably intact. 
        Historical records show that in the later Peshwa period, Nana Phadnavis 
        (1742-1800 AD) built several structures in the fort such as a big tank and a 
        step-well (bawali).On the west side, there is a long and narrow wall-like 
        fortified spur called Vinchukata (Marathi for Scorpion&#39;s tail; see picture) 
        because of its shape. Lohagad has a long history with several dynasties 
        occupying it at different periods of time: Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, 
        Yadavas, Bahamanis, Nizamshahis, Mughals and Marathas. Shivaji captured it in 
        1648 CE, but he was forced to surrender it to the Mughals in 1665 CE by the 
        Treaty of Purandar. Shivaji recaptured the fort in 1670 CE and used it for 
        keeping his treasury.</p>

            Neemrana Fort Built since 1464 AD, Neemrana Fort-Palace is among India&#39;s oldest 
            heritage resorts. Neemrana became the third capital of the descendants of 
            Prithviraj Chauhan III, who was killed in battle by Mohammad Ghori in 1192 AD. 
            This picturesque site was chosen by Raja Rajdeo and Neemrana derived its name 
            from a brave local chieftain Nimola Meo, who when defeated by the Chauhans, 
            pleaded that his name be given to his lost kingdom.</p>

            Pratapgad Fort</h3>
        <p>
            Pratapgad (also transcribed Pratapgarh or Pratapgadh) is a large fort located in 
            Satara district, in the state of Maharashtra in India. Significant as the site 
            of the Battle of Pratapgad, the fort is now a popular tourist 
            destination.Pratapgad is located 15 kilometres from Poladpur and 22 kilometres 
            from Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill-station in the area. This fort stands 1,080 
            metres above sea level.The fort is built on a spur which overlooks the road 
            between the villages of Par and Kinesvar.</p>
        <h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            The Maratha king Shivaji commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime 
            minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the 
            banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was 
            completed in 1656.The Battle of Pratapgarh between Shivaji and Afzal Khan was 
            fought below the rampants of this fort on November 10, 1659. This was the first 
            major test of the fledgling kingdom&#39;s army, and set the stage of the 
            establishment of the Maratha empire.Pratapgad continued to be involved in 
            regional politics. Sakharam Bapu, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by 
            his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to 
            fort until he finally died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from 
            the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong 
            garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad.In 1818, as part of the Third 
            Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation. This was a 
            great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold, had 
            a large garrison, and could annoy much of the country round Wai.A 17-foot high 
            equestrian bronze statue of Shivaji was unveiled by Javaharlal Nehru, then Prime 
            Minister of India, on the 30th November 1957, the same year a road was 
            constructed by the Public Works Department from Kumbhrosi village up to fort. A 
            guest house and a national park were built inside the fort in 1960.The fort is 
            currently owned by Udayan Raje Bhosale, the heir of the Satara princely state</p>
        <h3>
            Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The fort can be divided into the lower fort and upper fort.The upper fort was 
            built upon the crest of the hill. It is roughly square, 180m long on each side. 
            It has several permanent buildings, including a temple to the god Mahadev. It is 
            located at the northwest of the fort, and is surrounded by sheer cliffs with 
            drops of up to 250m.The lower fort is around 320m long and 110m wide. It is 
            located at the southeast of the fort, and is defended by towers and bastions ten 
            to twelve metres high.The Afzul tower extends out from the fort proper and 
            defends the approach to the fort. It is said to have been constructed after the 
            Battle of Pratapgad, and Afzul Khan&#39;s head is said to be buried under the 
            tower.In 1661, Shivaji was unable to visit the temple of the goddess Bhavani at 
            Tuljapur. He decided to dedicate a temple to the goddess at this fort itself. 
            This temple is on the eastern side of the lower fort. The hall has been rebuilt 
            since the original construction, and consists of wooden pillars about 50&#39; long, 
            30&#39; broad and 12&#39; high. The shrine is made of stone, and contains a clothed 
            black stone image of the goddess. The roof of the temple is flat inside, but 
            covered in lead covering put up by the Satara Raja Pratapsinh (1818-1839). A 
            small spire or shikhar covers the shrine.A darga of Afzul Khan is located a 
            short while away from the fort to the south-east.</p>

            is the smaller of the two and is on the eastern side of the main fort. The 
            village Purandar takes its name from this fort.Purandhar fort has a National 
            Cadet Corps Academy. It is a favorite destination for paragliders and trekkers</p>
        <h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            The earliest known mention of Purandhar is in the reign of the first Bahmani 
            king, Hasan Gangu. When he obtained possession of Maharashtra,he fortified 
            Purandhar in 1350. During the early rule of the Bijapur and Ahmednagar kings, 
            Purandhar was among the forts directly under Government, and never entrusted to 
            jagirdars (estate-holders).[2] Sometime under the Bedar kings (1347 -1490) the 
            fort was besieged several times. To prevent Purandar fort from falling, a man 
            and a woman were buried alive under one of the fort bastions to appease its 
            patron deity.In 1596, when Bahudar Shah of Ahmednagar sultanate granted Maloji 
            Bhosale(grandfather of Shivaji) Poona and Supa, the fort of Purandhar was 
            included as well. In 1646, a 16-year-old Shivaji in one of the first victories 
            of his legandary career, established control in the fort. In 1665, it was 
            besieged by the forces of Aurangzeb, under the command of Raja Jai Singh, a 
            Rajput general, assisted by Diler Khan, an Afghan. The defense of Purandar by 
            Murarbaji Deshpande of Mhar, the killedar (keeper of the fort) was obstinate and 
            he lost his life in the struggle to retain the fort. Shivaji daunted at the 
            prospect of the fall of his grandfathers fort, signed a treaty (the first Treaty 
            of Purandar) with Aurangzeb. Purandar fort along with Vajragad, Sinhgad and 22 
            other forts came under the Aurangzeb&#39;s control and Shivaji became his jagirdar 
            (glorified tenant). This truce did not last long as Shivaji revolted against 
            Aurangzeb and recaptured Purandhar only five years later in 1670. Thereafter, 
            Shivaji spent prolonged periods of time here. Sambhaji, Shivaji&#39;s eldest son and 
            successor was born at Purandar fort.Under the Peshwas, Purandhar was a 
            stronghold to which they retreated whenever Pune, their capital, was under 
            attack. Likely because the fort commands a pass through the Sahyadri mountain 
            range. In 1776, a treaty was signed between the British Government and the 
            Maratha States(the second Treaty of Purandar). Its conditions were never 
            fulfilled, being overruled by the subsequent Treaty of Salbai in 1782 between 
            the Bombay Government and Raghunathrao, at the close of the First Anglo-Maratha 
            War.In 1818, Purandhar was invested by a British force under General Pritzler. 
            On the 14th of March, a British garrison marched into Vajragad the smaller fort. 
            As Vajarad commanded Purandhar, the commandant had to accept terms and the 
            British flag was hoisted at Purandhar on the 16th March, 1818.During British 
            rule it was used as a prison. A German prisoner Dr. H. Goetz was kept here 
            during World War II. He studied the fort during his stay there and later 
            published a book on it. It major use however was as a sanatorium for British 
            soldiers.</p>
        <h3>
            Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The fort has two distinct levels. The lower part is called the machi. North of 
            the machi is a flat area where the cantonment and hospital was housed. There are 
            many temples decicated to Purandeshwar(the fort&#39;s patron god, from which it also 
            takes its name) and Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa here. There is a statue of Murarbaji 
            Deshapnde, the fort-keeper (killedar) who gave his life to protect the fort from 
            the Mughals. The northern part of the machi has a low fall with several bastions 
            and an imposing gate with two towers.From the lower level a staircase leads to 
            the upper level or Ballekilla. The first structure of the Ballekilla that comes 
            into view is the Dilli Darwaza. This area also houses an ancient 
            Kedareshwar(Shiva) temple. The higher level called Ballekilla is surrounded by 
            steep drop on three sides.</p>

    <h3>
        Raigad Fort</h3>
    <p>
        Raigad (Marathi:रायगड) is a hill fortress situated in the modern day Raigad 
        district of Maharashtra, India. The Maratha king Shivaji made the fort his 
        capital in 1674 when he was crowned King of a Maratha Kingdom which later 
        developed into the Maratha Empire eventually covering majority of modern day 
        India.The fort, which rises 820 metres (2,700 ft) above sea level, is located in 
        the Sahyadri mountain range. There are approximately 1400–1450 steps leading to 
        the fort, though today a rope-way exists to reach the top of the fort. The fort 
        was looted and destroyed by the British upon siege.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Shivaji Maharaj had seized the site, then the fortress of Rairi, from the royal 
        house of the Chandrarrao Mores, a junior or Cadet dynasty descended from the 
        ancient Maurya imperial dynasty. The last More king (or raja) was a feudatory of 
        the Sultan of Bijapur. Shivaji renovated and expanded the Fortress of Rairi and 
        renamed it Raigad (the King&#39;s Fort), the name he gave it when he selected it for 
        his capital when he founded the Maratha empire. Rajgad, a hill fortress situated 
        in Raigad District of Maharashtra, India was capital of Shivaji&#39;s kingdom.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The fort&#39;s ruins today consist of the queen&#39;s quarters, consisting of six 
        chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom with plumbing. The 
        main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the bases of pillars 
        remain. Ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace 
        grounds overlooking an artificial lake called Ganga Sagar Lake created next to 
        the fort. It also has a view of the execution point called Takmak Tok, a cliff 
        from which the sentenced prisoners were thrown to their death. This areas is now 
        fenced off.[1]. The fort also has ruins of the market, and it has such structure 
        that one can shop even while riding or sitting astride a horse.The king&#39;s public 
        Durbar has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called 
        the Nagarkhana Darwaja. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid 
        hearing from the doorway to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the Mena 
        Darwaja, was supposedly the private entrance of the royal ladies of the fort; it 
        leads to the queen&#39;s quarters. The erstwhile main entrance to the fort is the 
        imposing Maha Darwaja. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the 
        Palkhi Darwaja. To the right of Palkhi Darwaja, is a row of three dark and deep 
        chambers. Historians believe that these were the granaries for the fort.A statue 
        of Chhatrapati Shivaji is erected in front of the ruins of the main market 
        avenue that eventually leads to the Jagdishwar Mandir and his own Samadhi (tomb) 
        and that of his dog Waghya.</p>

            Rajgad Fort</h3>
        <p>
            Rajgad (Marathi: राजगड), literally meaning King of forts, one of the forts of 
            Maharashtra state in India. Situated in the Pune district, the fort is 
            approximately 4250 feet above sea level.Formerly known as Murumdev, it was 
            capital of the Maratha Kingdom (Hindavi Swarajya) ruled by Chhatrapati Shivaji 
            Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which he moved to Raigad and made that his 
            capital.Treasure found on adjacent Torna Fort was used to fortify this hill.The 
            fort is 42 km to the south west of Pune, about 15–16 km west of Nasrapur, in the 
            Sahyadris range.</p>
        <h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            This fort is built on the hill called &quot;Murumb Devacha Dongar&quot; Rajgad boasts the 
            highest number of days stayed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on any fort.This 
            fort has witnessed lots of historic events, including the birth of Rajaram 
            Chhatrapati, the death of Shivaji&#39;s Queen Saibai, the return of Shivaji from 
            Agra, the antyayatra of Tanaji Malusare to his Konkan village, the burial of 
            Afzal Khan&#39;s head in the Mahadarwaja walls of Ballekilla, the strict words of 
            Sonopant Dabir to Shivaji, and the Khandoji Khopade episode. The diameter of the 
            fort at the base is 40 km making it difficult for anybody to lay siege to it.</p>
        <h3>
            Architecture</h3>
        <p>

            Siri Fort</h3>
        <p>
            Siri is the second city of Delhi and was built by Sultan Alaud-Din Khilji in 
            about 1303, to the north of Mehrauli. The few remains of the city can be seen in 
            the Siri Fort complex near the Asian Games Village area, east of Hauz Khas. 
            Visitors can reach the fort complex by either taking the Khel Gaon Marg on the 
            west or Josip Broz Tito Marg on the east. High Rubble-built walls in stretches 
            in the southern direction and western direction, some bastions and flame-shaped 
            battlements are all that are left of the strong fortress city today which 
            compelled ferocious fighters like the Mongols to accept defeat. The city derives 
            its name from the Hindi word sir meaning head because about 8000 heads of Mongol 
            soldiers were buried in the walls of the city.Siri Fort is one of the many forts 
            of Delhi, which were built during the time of the Delhi Sultanate (AD 1191-1526) 
            in the medieval age. The kingdom of Delhi was constantly threatened by hoards of 
            Mongol tribesmen who had been descending in waves to loot India since the 13th 
            century. The Slave dynasty (AD 1193-1290), which was the first dynasty of the 
            Delhi Sultanate, also faced this threat in the later half of its reign. Balban, 
            the last important ruler of this dynasty successfully countered the Mongol 
            threat. In the course of time, the reins of the Delhi Sultanate passed into the 
            hands of the Khilji Dynasty (AD 1290-1316).Siri Fort commands a special place in 
            the realms of history because of the various aspects. The very first is that, 
            Siri was the second city to be built in Delhi and the second is that, it was 
            never conquered. The city was build by Sultan Alaud-Din Khilji in year 1303. The 
            city was situated in a ravine north of Qutab Minar.

        <h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            Ala-ud-din Khilji was a powerful ruler who belonged to the Khilji dynasty that 
            ruled the Delhi Sultanate. He was also a great patron of architecture and to him 
            goes the credit of getting the Siri Fort in Delhi constructed. The fort was 
            mainly built by Ala-ud-din to protect the people of his capital from the 
            frequent invasions of the Mongols, who easily penetrated the weak defenses of 
            India&#39;s borders time and again to reach all the way up to Delhi. He succeeded in 
            his mission of protecting his subjects after building the Siri Fort.Ala-ud-din 
            Khilji ascended the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in AD 1296. He was a strong 
            monarch, who was constantly expanding his empire. Ala-ud-din was also a great 
            builder. He built the fort city at Siri, which served as the administrative 
            center of the Khilji kingdom and was the first city in Delhi to be built by the 
            Muslim rulers of India. The rulers of the Slave dynasty, who were the first 
            Muslim rulers of India and the first dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate before the 
            Khiljis, used Lal Kot, the fort city of the last Hindu rulers of Delhi. He also 
            began to put into shape his grand plans of beautifying the Qutab Minar complex. 
            He added the Alai Darwaza, a magnificent gateway with inlaid marble decorations 
            and latticed stone screens, which showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the 
            Turkish artisans who worked on it. He also planned to build the Alai Minar, 
            which was conceived as a greater tower than the already existing Qutab Minar but 
            the construction of this tower was abandoned after the completion of the 
            24.5-meter high first story.In AD 1303, the Mongols under their leader Taraghai 
            plundered Delhi and almost captured it. However the marauders did not capture 
            the city and without reason turned back and left. Meanwhile, Ala-ud-din Khilji 
            was away from Delhi, busy in one of his military campaigns in the Deccan region 
            in South India. Returning back to Delhi from his Deccan campaign, Ala-ud-din 
            Khilji decided to build a defensive fortress at Siri with strong fortified 
            ramparts and impregnable bastions. This was the third fort to be built within 
            the city of Delhi. The construction of the Siri Fort and the city within it 
            began in AD 1304. The place he chose was a plain ground around five km to the 
            north-east of the Qutab Minar where forces attacking or defending Delhi used to 
            camp.

    <h3>
        Umaid Bhawan Palace</h3>
    <p>
        Umaid Bhawan Palace, located at Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India, is one of the 
        world&#39;s largest private residences. A part of the palace is managed by Taj 
        Hotels. Named after Maharaja Umaid Singh, grandfather of the present owners of 
        the palace, this monument has 347 rooms and serves as the principal residence of 
        the erstwhile Jodhpur royal family.Umaid Bhawan Palace was called Chittar Palace 
        during its construction due to its location on Chittar Hill, the highest point 
        in Jodhpur. Ground for the foundations of the building was broken on 18 November 
        1929 by Maharaja Umaid Singh and the construction work was completed in 1943.</p>
    <h3>
        History</h3>
    <p>
        Mehrangarh was the soul of the Rathore clan that would never change. But 
        tireless builders that they were, Rao Jodha&#39;s original masterpiece had been 
        altered repeatedly. And some of the alterations were in the powerful Moghul 
        style that dominated much of the country&#39;s landscape. Its scalloped arches, 
        domes, floral carvings, botanical paintings, water courses etc. Umaid Singh&#39;s 
        Chittar Palace, on the other hand, brought back the Rajput tradition.The majesty 
        of the palace was only to be expected. It was, after all, built by a blood line 
        that probably went back all the way to the Rashtrakutas, the Kshatriya kings 
        responsible for creating one of the oldest Hindu architectural traditions in 
        India with the Kailasanatha temple strewn from living rock.Umaid Singh grew up 
        on the cusp of a world in transition. The East India Company (aka the John 
        Company) had been humbled by the great uprising in the Indian sepoy troops. The 
        rebellion ushered in the British Imperialist era, and since the Rajputs remained 
        loyal to the John Company, the British aristocracy grudgingly welcomed the 
        princely states into their club. Umaid Singh, already integrated into the 
        traditions of the past, was educated in one of the Princes&#39; Colleges in the 
        tradition of Eton, Rugby, Winchester and the other great British public schools 
        of the time. He, like most of his clan at the time, was educated to be 
        sophisticated, worldly and competitive. At the tender age of sixteen, he was 
        pushed unexpectedly into the role of a Maharaja. Five years later, he gained 
        full monarchical powers. The British and his regent, Sir Pratap Singh, used 
        those intervening years to open the monarch&#39;s eyes to the possibilities that 
        order and bureaucracy held for Marwar.The lead project that would usher Jodhpur 
        into the twentieth century was to be the new palace. It had to be large enough, 
        grand enough, breathtaking enough to deserve taking the place of Meherangarh 
        Fort as the symbol of Jodhpur. In 1924, the Maharaja met with Henry Vaughn 
        Lanchester. He had spent decades travelling the world as architect and town 
        planner, and was no stranger to the traditions of Hindu architecture. While 
        discussing his vision for the palace, Lanchester outlined his strong stand 
        against the Moghul aesthetic, arguing that the States of Rajasthan came under 
        Moslem domination only to a limited extent, and their traditions very rarely 
        made use of Mughal features. Umaid Singh knew he had found his man.Determined to 
        incorporate the traditions and unique world view of the land in his concept, 
        Lanchester went eons back to the Hindu mountain temples for his inspiration 
        behind Umaid Bhawan Palace. Umaid Singh knew immediately it would be a fitting 
        tribute to his ancestors. But it is by no means a new antique. Umaid Singh was 
        free of the archaic nineteenth-century lifestyle and in love with progress. 
        While his palace may have been inspired by tradition, it was, at the insistence 
        of the forward-thinking monarch, built on the cutting edge of progress.</p>
    <h3>
        Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Built on the Chittar Hill in southeastern area of the Jodhpur, construction 
        employed more than 5000 men for fifteen years. The building does not use mortar 
        or cement to bind stones together; all of its pieces are carved stones joined 
        together by a system of carved, interlocking positive and negative pieces. A 
        specially constructed train line was used to transport these large blocks of 
        stone. Umaid Bhavan is designed in such a manner that it always maintains the 
        temperature at approximately 23 degrees Celsius.The palace grounds cover 26 
        acres (10.5 ha), out of which the constructed area covers 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) 
        while 15 acres (6.1 ha) are devoted to the lawns.Designed by renowned Edwardian 
        architect Henry Lanchester, the palace is a blend of eastern and western 
        architectural influences. The building&#39;s prominent central dome, a majestic 
        105-foot (32 m) high cupola, is influenced by the Renaissance, while the towers 
        draw inspiration from Rajput tradition. The project was to cost the Maharaja Rs 
        94,51,565. The resident engineer for this project was Hiranand U. Bhatia. The 
        interiors for the palace were designed by Maples of London, however, in 1942 the 
        ship transporting them was sunk by the Germans. As a result, the Maharaja 
        employed the services of a Polish interior designer Stefan Norblin. The lavish 
        interiors with gilt furniture and elegant artwork follow the Art Deco style, 
        complemented by the exotic murals of the self-exiled Polish artist Stefan 
        Norblin. The new Chittar Palace was a fitting tribute to its ancestor, the 
        imposing and majestic Meherangarh Fort, which was built by Rao Jodha and has 
        never been conquered by force of arms</p>
