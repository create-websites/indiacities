        History Of Hyderabad</h3>
    <p>
        Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh is a bustling 400 year old metropolis 
        with an urban population of 4.2 million people approximately. The city is 
        cosmopolitan, and is richly endowed with a variety of cultures. The city 
        presents an attractive amalgam of old world charm together with ebullience of 
        growth and enterprise. Beautiful old edifices built in the medieval, large glass 
        and chrome temples of commerce. The history of Hyderabad begins with the 
        establishment of the Qutub Shahi dynasty. Quli Qutub Shah seized the reins of 
        power from the Bahamani Kingdom in 1512 and established the fortress city of 
        Golconda. Inadequacy of water, and frequent epidemics of plague and cholera 
        persuaded Mohammed, the fifth Quli Qutub Shahi ruler to venture outward to 
        establish the new city with the Charminar at its center and with four great 
        roads fanning out in the four cardinal directions. Hyderabad&#39;s fame, strategic 
        location and Golconda&#39;s legendary wealth attracted Aurangazeb who captured 
        Golconda after a long siege in 1687. After this defeat the importance of 
        Hyderabad declined and the city fell into partial ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the Mughal Empire decayed and began to disintegrate, the victory, Asaf Jah-I 
        proclaimed himself the Nizam and established independent rule of the Deccan. 
        Hyderabad once again became a major capital city, ruled by successive Nizams of 
        the Asaf Jah dynasty until the state was merged into the Indian Union in 1948.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1798, a subsidiary alliance for military and political cooperation was signed 
        between the Nizam and the British East India company. Thereafter, an area north 
        of what is now the Hussain Sagar lake was established as a cantonment. The area 
        was named Secunderabad after the then Nizam, Sikander Jah. Both Hyderabad and 
        Secunderabad grew together and have now merged. An imaginary line drawn across 
        the Tank Bund is still used to distinguish the two cities..

        Culture Of Hyderabad</h3>
    <p>
        The infamous Hyderabadi pearl Culture. Who hasn&#39;t heard about the soft, rounded, 
        luminescent, tear drop pearl of Hyderabad. People form everywhere flock here to 
        possess a few of these pearls. But why Hyderabad? It neither is on the sea coast 
        nor near to it. Yet it has become almost synonymous with pearls. It is because 
        of the city&#39;s grand and very old history. Hyderabad was a princely state and a 
        very rich one too! The royal patronage saw to the burgeoning growth of arts, 
        crafts and cuisine. Their rich life-styles beckoned many a craftsman from 
        distant parts of the world, especially the Arabian Gulf where the rare original 
        pearls are found in abundance. Hence, Hyderabad became the one-stop-destination 
        for pearls. There is an entire street which only comprises of pearl shops - 
        Patther Gatti.

    <p>
        The documented history of Golconda goes back to the Kakatiya Dynasty in 11th 
        century when they built a mud fortress on a hill called Golconda. During the 
        span of 800 years from Kakatiya to Qutub Shahi rulers, the fort-city grew and 
        prospered. During the reign of Qutub Shahi rulers, espically at time of Mohammed 
        Qutub Shahi the culture reaches its zenith. Most of the places of interest in 
        the area pertain to Qutub Shahi Era. The majestic ruins of Golconda stands as a 
        backdrop to the city of Hyderabad. The orginal fort was built by Kakatiyas in 
        1143. It went to the hands of Bahmani Kings in (1364-1507). Quli Qutub-ul- Mulk 
        declared Golconda as an independent Kingdom and assumed the title of Sultan Quli 
        Qutub Shahi I. The original mud fortress was strengthened during the next 62 
        years. The walls and bastions were built of large blocks of masonry, some 
        weighing 7 tons. The fort&#39;s outmost walls traverse a circumference of
