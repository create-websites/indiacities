    <p>
        Nowadays there is good road connectivity between Delhi to Agra and Jaipur. There 
        is a direct train called <b>Taj express, Rajdhani express</b>. For Jaipur you 
        have a train - <b>Pink City Express</b>. You can reach Agra in 3 hours. Visit 
        Taj Mahal and go back to Delhi on same day. You can take a taxi and reach Agra 
        in 4-5 hours using <b>GT Road</b>. Fortunately a new high way is opened from 
        Delhi-Noida-Agra and it takes you faster to Agra.</p>
